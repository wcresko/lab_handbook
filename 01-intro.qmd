## Who We Are

We are a scientific community of geneticists who specializes in quantitative evolutionary genomics. Our laboratory studies the developmental genetic and genomic basis of evolution in natural populations.

## Our Model Systems

We use several animal models in our research:

- **Threespine stickleback** - Our primary model organism
- **Zebrafish** - For comparative developmental studies
- **Syngnathids** (pipefish and seahorses) - For evolutionary and developmental studies

## Stickleback as a Model

We have produced some of the first work that has helped develop stickleback into a model for dissecting the genetic basis of natural variation. See our protocols in @sec-stickleback-husbandry for detailed husbandry information.

## Our Research Contributions

### Genomic Tools Development

We have developed cutting-edge genomic tools including:

- **RAD-seq Technology**: We developed sequenced Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) tags that help geneticists apply Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies to biomedical and evolutionary genetic problems
- **SNP Identification**: These techniques allow for the efficient identification of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genomes of models and non-model organisms
- **Whole Genome Scans**: We produced the first SNP whole genome-scan for selection in the stickleback genome

### Computational Biology

Computational biologists and computer scientists in our team have:

- Developed novel Maximum Likelihood (ML) analytical tools for NGS data
- Produced software packages for genomic analyses that are used by laboratories around the world
- Created tools for RNA-seq based transcriptomic functional analyses

## Software and Tools

Our laboratory has developed protocols, best practices, and tools for RNA-seq based transcriptomic functional analyses. Many of these are freely available and used by researchers worldwide.

## Getting Started

New lab members should:

1. Read through this entire manual, particularly @sec-expectations and @sec-lab-safety
2. Complete all required safety training (see @sec-lab-safety)
3. Meet with your supervisor to discuss your project
4. Familiarize yourself with relevant protocols for your research

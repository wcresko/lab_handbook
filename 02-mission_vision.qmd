## Our Mission

The Cresko Laboratory is dedicated to advancing our understanding of evolutionary developmental biology through rigorous scientific inquiry, innovative methodologies, and collaborative research. We strive to:

- Conduct cutting-edge research in evolutionary genomics and developmental biology
- Train the next generation of scientists in quantitative and genomic approaches
- Foster a collaborative, inclusive, and supportive research environment
- Contribute to the broader scientific community through open science practices

## Our Vision

We envision a laboratory that:

- Leads in the integration of genomic, developmental, and evolutionary approaches
- Produces impactful research that advances fundamental biological knowledge
- Develops and shares tools and resources that benefit the scientific community
- Cultivates scientists who are technically skilled, intellectually curious, and ethically grounded

## Core Values

## Research Philosophy

Our research philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Question-driven research**: We pursue fundamental questions about evolutionary and developmental processes
2. **Methodological innovation**: We develop new tools and approaches when existing ones are insufficient
3. **Reproducibility**: We document our methods thoroughly and share our protocols
4. **Biological insight**: We seek to understand mechanisms, not just describe patterns

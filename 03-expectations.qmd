## Scientific Ethics and Integrity {#sec-scientific-ethics}

::: {.callout-important}
## Core Principles

All lab members are expected to uphold the highest standards of scientific integrity in all aspects of their work. This includes:

- Honest and accurate reporting of data and results
- Proper attribution of ideas and contributions
- Adherence to ethical guidelines for animal research (see @sec-iacuc)
- Transparency in methods and analysis
- Responsible data management and record-keeping
:::

### Key Responsibilities

- **Data Integrity**: Never fabricate, falsify, or manipulate data
- **Proper Documentation**: Maintain detailed, accurate lab notebooks and records
- **Reproducibility**: Document methods thoroughly so others can reproduce your work
- **Conflicts of Interest**: Disclose any potential conflicts of interest
- **Responsible Authorship**: Follow guidelines outlined in @sec-authorship

::: {.callout-note}
## Questions or Concerns?

If you have questions about research ethics or encounter any ethical concerns, please discuss them immediately with Dr. Cresko or your supervisor. The university also has resources for reporting research misconduct.

## Authorship of Manuscripts {#sec-authorship}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Best Practice

**At the start of each project, design your plan for authorship so everyone knows the expectations.** This prevents misunderstandings and ensures fair recognition of contributions.
:::

### Authorship Criteria

To qualify as an author on a manuscript, an individual must meet ALL of the following criteria:

::: {#authorship-criteria}
**1. Intellectual or Practical Contribution**

Makes a significant intellectual contribution to research ideas and experimental design

**OR**

Makes a significant contribution to data acquisition, data generation, data analysis, data interpretation, research coordination, and/or financial support of research

**AND**

**2. Writing Contribution**

Contributes to writing part of the manuscript, in addition to editing revisions before submission for publication

**AND**

**3. Ongoing Involvement**

Remains involved throughout the submission and revision process until final publication
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Acknowledgments

Research participants not meeting the authorship criteria should be listed in the Acknowledgments section of the final published manuscript. This ensures all contributors receive appropriate recognition.
:::

### Authorship Order

The order of authors on a manuscript typically follows these guidelines:

- **First Author**: The person who had the most significant contribution to the project and who does most of the writing
- **Last Author**: Generally the PI of the lab (although not always in ecology/evolution)
- **Middle Authors**: Usually listed in order of contribution

::: {.callout-tip}
## Special Cases

If contributions were equivalent, then co-authors can be:

- Listed alphabetically, or
- Ordered according to their time since involvement in the project

When using co-first authors or other non-standard arrangements, this should be explicitly stated in the manuscript.

## Communication and Collaboration

- Attend and participate in lab meetings
- Communicate regularly with your supervisor about progress and challenges
- Collaborate generously with other lab members
- Share protocols and troubleshooting insights
- Respect shared lab spaces and equipment (see @sec-lab-safety)

## Work Expectations

- Maintain accurate and complete lab notebooks
- Follow all safety protocols (see @sec-lab-safety)
- Complete required training in a timely manner
- Plan and conduct experiments thoughtfully
- Analyze data carefully and critically
- Present your work at lab meetings and scientific conferences when appropriate

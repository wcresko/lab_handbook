__FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS, HEED THE FOLLOWING RULES!__

EMERGENCY CONTACT: dial 911 first, _AND_  6-2919 (EHS) | Mark Cell 541-505-0006

**Safety Shower, Eyewash, Fire Extinguishers.**  

Eyewashes must be flushed weekly. _Undergraduate research assistants are responsible for flushing the safety showers each week._ _Each lab member is responsible for knowing the locations of safety showers and fire extinguishers in the lab.  Safety showers and fire extinguishers are tested annually by EHS. 

**Wear a lab coat and closed-toed shoes when working with the following chemicals:**

- organics (e.g. phenol/chloroform, Trizol, DNAzol, formaldehyde, formamide, methanol)
- strong acids and bases

**Wear eye protection when working with:**

- UV light (UV opaque glasses/face shield) 

- phenol/chloroform, strong acids/bases, and any splash hazard with anything hazardous in it. 

**Wear safety gloves when working with ANY of the reagents above.**

Heed the “one glove rule”: remove one glove when moving between rooms to avoid touching doorknobs with a contaminated glove. Note that glove materials differ in their permeability to different reagents. Standard nitrile gloves are adequate for our lab’s standard procedures. However, if you are planning experiments that involve more dangerous reagents, consult with Luke Sitts at EHS to select appropriate gloves.

**Disposal of common hazardous reagents (EHS DISPOSAL: 6-3192)**

- E. coli plates and recombinant materials: autoclave buckets or EHS biohazard incineration boxes

- E. coli flasks/liquids: bleach, rinse, drain

- Used alcohols, formaldehyde, and kit waste: waste containers under the thermocyclers.  

- organic solvents: waste bottles in hood. 

**Storage of Hazardous Liquids**

- Store flammables and strong acids in a latched METAL SAFETY CABINET UNDER THE HOOD.

Heating Liquids in the Microwave Oven**

Triple check that the cap is _very_ loose or (better) remove it entirely. Remelting of gels with DNA binding dyes is forbidden.

**Bunsen Burners**

- Triple check that the gas is shut completely off before you leave the bench/ hood. 

- keep burners far away from any flammable liquids. 

**Liquid Nitrogen and Dry Ice** 

- Use only in well ventilated spaces to avoid asphyxiation.  

- Never store in sealed containers to avoid explosions

- Wear lab coat, gloves, goggles. In case of frostbite or burn, soak affected part in tepid water, seek medical attention

## Lone Worker Guidelines

The UO Laboratory Safety Advisory Committee (LSAC) feels that working alone in laboratories should be discouraged but recognizes that a prohibition would hinder the research and education missions of the UO. 

To advance personnel safety while also recognizing research needs, the LSAC developed this guidance document to assist lab workers in recognizing dangers and developing appropriate procedures.  

The primary danger in working alone is that if an accident should occur, there will be delays in rendering aid.   

### Before working alone, you should:

1. Ensure that you have been trained on the procedures, reviewed the safety data sheets for all associate materials, and know the emergency procedures for your lab.
2. Consider whether the risk outweighs the benefits of working alone. 
3. Consider whether this work can be done at a time when others are around.
4. Consider using a buddy system with individuals in other labs nearby.   

If you decide to proceed with hazardous procedures on your own, please use a check-in or text-in system with supervisors or peers, ensuring that they know where and when this work is done and that they have contact information readily available for campus safety personnel. 

### Specific Guidelines for the Cresko Lab

Examples of materials and procedures in THIS laboratory that should be avoided while working alone are provided below. Should you choose to do lone work of this nature, ensure that others know where and when this work will be performed, and when it is completed.

**Building & Room**:  *Pacific 310 & 324*    
**Supervisor**: *Dr. William Cresko*

**In this laboratory these chemicals or procedures will not be used or done while working alone:** 

*The use of phenol chloroform and the movement of glass aquariums will not be done while working alone in Pacific 310 or 324.*   

**In this laboratory, these procedures will not be conducted while working alone:**

*Procedures that require the use of phenol chloroform or the movement of glass aquariums*

**Other safety considerations for working alone in this laboratory:**

*Emergencies – Dial 911*

# LONE WORKER GUIDELINES FOR LABORATORY PERSONNEL

The UO Laboratory Safety Advisory Committee (LSAC) feels that working alone in laboratories should be discouraged but recognizes that a prohibition would hinder the research and education missions of the UO. To advance personnel safety while also recognizing research needs, the LSAC developed this guidance document to assist lab workers in recognizing dangers and developing appropriate procedures.  

The primary danger in working alone is that if an accident should occur, there will be delays in rendering aid.   

Before working alone, you should:

1. Ensure that you have been trained on the procedures, reviewed the safety data sheets for all associate materials, and know the emergency procedures for your lab.
2. 	Consider whether the risk outweighs the benefits of working alone. 
3. 	Consider whether this work can be done at a time when others are around.
4. 	Consider using a buddy system with individuals in other labs nearby.   

If you decide to proceed with hazardous procedures on your own, please use a check-in or text-in system with supervisors or peers, ensuring that they know where and when this work is done and that they have contact information readily available for campus safety personnel.

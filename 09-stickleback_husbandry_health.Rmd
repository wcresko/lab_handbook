## Fish Density Standards
(created by M Currey, August 25, 2011, updated by mcc 151125)

These standards for fish densities are what we in the Cresko lab have determined optimal after 12 years of keeping threespine stickleback in a recirculating aquaculture system.

### Fry (9dpf - 2 months):

•	Fry are kept in 2.8 L tanks at an ideal density of 20 fish per container. Fry can be kept in densities of up to 40 fish per tank. If fish densities are near 40 per tank fish are transferred or thinned after 1 month of age. 

### Juvenile (2 months - 4 months) Grow Out:

•	Juvenile fish are transferred from fry tanks into 9.5 L tanks and kept at a density of 20 fish per container. 

Grow out (4 months – 1 year), Adult (1 year - 1.5 years) and Breeding conditioning:

•	Grow out: Juvenile fish are transferred to 20 gallon tanks in the Winter room at an ideal density of 20 fish per container. Fish can be kept at a density of 40 fish per tank if space is needed. 
•	Breeding Conditioning: Once fish are 1 year of age (or older), transfer adult fish to the Summer room. Stickleback males become sexually mature 2-6 weeks after experiencing Summer conditions, females become sexually mature 4-6 weeks after experiencing Summer conditions conditions. Conditioned fish can stay in the Summer room for 5 months.

## Juvenile Collection (Daily):  

1.	Turn off water to tanks. 

2.	Remove collection cup, using mysid system water, rinse juveniles into plastic container. 

3.	Pour juveniles into grow out tank.

4.	Replace collection cup.

5.	Turn water on and start siphon. 

## Adult mysid collection and feeding: 

1.	Juvenile will reach adult size in three weeks. At three weeks these new adults will replace old breeding adults. The old breeding adults that are being replaced are feed to the pipefish. 

2.	Let juveniles grow to three weeks at which point they reach adult stage.

3.	Siphon adults through a net and collect in a container.

4.	Siphon old adults out of one of the 10 gallon tanks and feed to fish.

5.	Clean tank, fill with water, and add new adult mysids.

## Health Check - Sick and Dead Fish {#sec-health-check}

::: {.callout-note}
Created 4/14/08 by M Currey, updated 151201 by mcc
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Daily Requirement

Check for sick and dead fish **daily** by looking through all tanks. This is best done when feeding. When done, complete the checklist and email Mark. Symptoms of sick and distressed fish are posted in the fish room.
:::

### Materials Needed

- Fish Morgue consisting of a small bucket with lid and a sealable plastic bag
- Mesab, a.k.a. MS222, tricaine or 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester
- Small container
- Net

### Procedure for Dead Fish

1. Make note of the number of fish, tank space, and what stock the fish was from on the daily check list
2. With a clean net, remove fish and place into fish morgue (The fish morgue can be found in the chest freezer. It is a small bucket labeled "Fish Morgue" on the lid)

### Procedure for Sick Fish

1. Make note on tank and contact supervisor

::: {.callout-warning}
## Reporting Requirements

Please email Mark with a list of all sick and dead fish along with tank position at the end of each shift: [mcurrey@uoregon.edu](mailto:mcurrey@uoregon.edu)

**If there are numerous sick or dead fish, contact immediately:**

## Adult Fish Anesthesia, Euthanasia, and Fixation {#sec-anesthesia-euthanasia}

::: {.callout-note}
Created 4/14/08 by M Currey, updated 151201 by mcc
:::

::: {.callout-important}
## Tricaine Requirements

**Tricaine must be pharmaceutical-grade.** We use tricaine purchased from Aquatic Ecosystems, manufactured by Western Chemical and FDA approved.

These procedures are to be done on fish larger than 5mm in length.
:::

### Materials Needed

- Fish Morgue consisting of a small bucket with lid and a sealable plastic bag
- Mesab, a.k.a. MS222, tricaine or 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester
- Small container
- Net

### Mesab Stock Solution (4g/L) {#sec-mesab-stock}

From Zebrafish Book 4th edition:

Tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester also called ethyl m-aminobenzoate) comes in a powdered form from Sigma (Cat.# A-5040). It is also available as Finquel (Part No. C-FINQ-UE) from Argent Chemical Laboratories, Inc.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Preparation

Make tricaine solution for anesthetizing fish by combining the following in a glass bottle with a screw cap:

**Stock Solution (4g/L):**

- 400 mg tricaine powder
- 97.9 ml DD water
- ~2.1 ml 1 M Tris (pH 9)

Adjust pH to ~7. **Store this solution in the freezer.**

*Buy the smallest amount possible because tricaine degrades over time.*
:::

### Euthanasia Protocol (300 mg/L) {#sec-euthanasia}

**Procedure:**

1. Make a solution of tris buffered Stock solution MS-222 solution as described in @sec-mesab-stock (or obtain solution from freezer)
2. Combine 7.5 ml of stock solution into 100 ml of fish water
3. Place fish into fish water/mesab solution for at least 10 minutes after cessation of opercular movement (~12 minutes total)
4. If fish is to be used for experiments, proceed with fixation or preparation of the experiment
5. If the fish are to be disposed of, place fish into fish morgue located in chest freezer in entry room

### Anesthesia Protocol (168 mg/L) {#sec-anesthesia}

**Procedure:**

1. Make a solution of tris buffered Stock solution MS-222 solution as described in @sec-mesab-stock (or obtain solution from freezer)
2. Combine 4.2 ml of stock solution into 100 ml of fish water
3. Place fish into 168 mg/L MS-222 solution and wait for the fish to slow down
4. Image or do other experiments quickly to minimize fish exposure to MS-222. **Pay attention to opercular movement to be sure that fish is alive**
5. Revive by placing in fish water and moving fish gently through the water to pass water over gills

### Liquid N₂ Freezing and Fixation in RNAlater {#sec-liquid-n2-fixation}

**Procedure:**

1. Anesthetize using concentration from @sec-anesthesia and allow fish to lay motionless with only slight opercle movement. This should take approximately 10 minutes
2. Place fish in liquid N₂ for 2 minutes. This instantaneously freezes the fish
3. Thaw into RNAlater-ICE

::: {.callout-warning}
## Safety

When using liquid nitrogen, follow all safety protocols outlined in @sec-equipment-safety.

## Embryo and Larval Euthanasia and Fixation {#sec-embryo-euthanasia}

::: {.callout-note}
Created 4/6/10 by M Currey
:::

These procedures are to be done with larval fish and fish up to 5mm in length.

### For Euthanasia

**Materials:**

- Fish Morgue
- Ice bath with basket (see below)

**Procedure:**

1. Place ice in insulated box (e.g., cooler or Styrofoam container)
2. Add water to make ice slurry
3. Add mesh basket so that ice water is allowed to enter but ice does not
4. Place embryos in ice water
5. Let embryos sit for 5 hour minimum
6. Dispose of dead embryos in fish morgue

### For RNA Extraction

**Materials:**

- RNAlater (Ambion cat # AM7021) or –80°C freezer
- 1.5 ml tubes
- Liquid nitrogen

**Procedure - RNAlater:**

1. Add RNAlater per manufacturer's recommendations
2. Place embryos in solution. This rapidly fixes embryos

**Procedure - Storage in -80°C Freezer:**

1. Place embryos in 1.5 ml tube
2. Put tube in liquid nitrogen for 2 minutes
3. Place tube in –80°C for RNA extraction

### For In Situ Hybridization

**Materials:**

- 4% buffered PFA
- 1.5 ml tubes
- 10 ml 10X PBS
- 90 ml sterile H₂O

::: {.callout-note}
## Making 4% PFA (100 ml)

1. Preheat to 60°C while stirring on heat plate
2. Add 4 g PFA
3. Heat and stir just until solution clears. **Do not let heat go above 60°C!** pH should be about 7.4
4. Store 10 ml aliquots at -20°C in 1.5 ml tubes
:::

**Procedure for Fixing:**

1. Place embryos in 1.5 ml tube
2. Add 1 ml 4% PFA
3. Store in –20°C freezer

::: {.callout-tip}
This rapidly fixes embryos for in situ hybridization.

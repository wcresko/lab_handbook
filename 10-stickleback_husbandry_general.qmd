## Fish Density Standards {#sec-density-standards}

::: {.callout-note}
Created by M Currey, August 25, 2011, updated by mcc 151125
:::

These standards for fish densities are what we in the Cresko lab have determined optimal after 12 years of keeping threespine stickleback in a recirculating aquaculture system.

### Fry (9 dpf - 2 months) {#sec-fry-density}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Density Guidelines

- Fry are kept in **2.8 L tanks** at an ideal density of **20 fish per container**
- Fry can be kept in densities of up to **40 fish per tank**
- If fish densities are near 40 per tank, fish are transferred or thinned after 1 month of age
:::

### Juvenile (2 months - 4 months) Grow Out {#sec-juvenile-density}

- Juvenile fish are transferred from fry tanks into **9.5 L tanks** and kept at a density of **20 fish per container**

### Grow Out, Adult, and Breeding Conditioning {#sec-adult-density}

**Grow Out (4 months – 1 year):**

- Juvenile fish are transferred to **20 gallon tanks** in the Winter room at an ideal density of **20 fish per container**
- Fish can be kept at a density of **40 fish per tank** if space is needed

**Adult (1 year - 1.5 years):**

- Maintained in 20 gallon tanks
- Ideal density of 20 fish per container

**Breeding Conditioning:**

::: {.callout-important}
## Breeding Preparation

- Once fish are **1 year of age (or older)**, transfer adult fish to the Summer room
- **Males** become sexually mature **2-6 weeks** after experiencing Summer conditions
- **Females** become sexually mature **4-6 weeks** after experiencing Summer conditions
- Conditioned fish can stay in the Summer room for **up to 5 months**

## Juvenile Collection (Daily) {#sec-juvenile-collection}

::: {.callout-note}
## Procedure

1. Turn off water to tanks
2. Remove collection cup, using mysid system water, rinse juveniles into plastic container
3. Pour juveniles into grow out tank
4. Replace collection cup
5. Turn water on and start siphon

## Adult Mysid Collection and Feeding {#sec-mysid-collection}

Mysids are used as live food for stickleback and pipefish. For more information on live food culture, see @sec-stickleback-feeding.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Mysid Lifecycle

1. Juveniles will reach adult size in three weeks
2. At three weeks these new adults will replace old breeding adults
3. The old breeding adults that are being replaced are fed to the pipefish
:::

### Procedure

1. Let juveniles grow to three weeks at which point they reach adult stage
2. Siphon adults through a net and collect in a container
3. Siphon old adults out of one of the 10 gallon tanks and feed to fish
4. Clean tank, fill with water, and add new adult mysids

SOP - Fish Density Standards
(created by M Currey, August 25, 2011, updated by mcc 151125)

These standards for fish densities are what we in the Cresko lab have determined optimal after 12 years of keeping threespine stickleback in a recirculating aquaculture system.

Fry (9dpf - 2 months):

•	Fry are kept in 2.8 L tanks at an ideal density of 20 fish per container. Fry can be kept in densities of up to 40 fish per tank. If fish densities are near 40 per tank fish are transferred or thinned after 1 month of age. 

Juvenile (2 months - 4 months) Grow Out:

•	Juvenile fish are transferred from fry tanks into 9.5 L tanks and kept at a density of 20 fish per container. 

Grow out (4 months – 1 year), Adult (1 year - 1.5 years) and Breeding conditioning:

•	Grow out: Juvenile fish are transferred to 20 gallon tanks in the Winter room at an ideal density of 20 fish per container. Fish can be kept at a density of 40 fish per tank if space is needed. 
•	Breeding Conditioning: Once fish are 1 year of age (or older), transfer adult fish to the Summer room. Stickleback males become sexually mature 2-6 weeks after experiencing Summer conditions, females become sexually mature 4-6 weeks after experiencing Summer conditions conditions. Conditioned fish can stay in the Summer room for 5 months.

## Embryo Bleaching for Disinfection
(created by M Currey, August 25, 2011, updated 151201 by mcc)

### Purpose:
This protocol allows the removal of ecto-parasites from embryos produced from wild-caught stickleback. Use this protocol whenever new fish are added to a pre-existing stickleback rearing system, or whenever stocks are transferred between labs. 

### Materials needed:
•	Wash bottle and petri dishes
•	Timer


## Solutions
•	 6% sodium hypochlorite (standard bleach)
•	 Working stock of bleach – 500µl of bleach into 1 liter of embryo medium (see rearing protocols)

## Procedure:
1.	 Raise embryos according to standard crossing and rearing protocols (see husbandry SOP)

2.	 At 48-60 hours post-fertilization (@ 20C – at this point most organogenesis is complete) remove embryo medium from petri dishes and rinse embryos once with fresh embryo medium.

3.	 Fill petri dish with working stock solution of bleach.  Swirl and let sit for 1.5 min. Do not bleach embryos for longer as chorions can thicken and it becomes difficult for embryos to hatch.

4.	 Drain bleach solution from embryos, and wash them three times with fresh embryo medium.  This is really important.

5.	 Replace embryo medium daily.  If crosses are done in the field, the embryos can be shipped from day 3 to day 6 post-fertilization.  To ship embryos, rinse once with embryo medium, place embryos into a 50ml conical tube (~100 embryos/tube) and fill with fresh embryo medium.  Place tubes in a shipping container with wet ice.  Separate the tubes from the ice with bubble-wrap and newspapers.  Ship the embryos overnight.  

6.	 When the embryos arrive at the lab, rinse the outside of the containers well before moving into the lab.  Allow them to equilibrate to room temp (~20C).  Place the embryos into petri dishes, rinse once, and add new embryo medium.  Rear according to standard protocol.

## SOP – Testes Storage
(created by M Currey, August 25, 2011, updated 151201 by mcc)

### Purpose: Storage of stickleback testes for fertilization up to 1-2 months post extraction. 
Materials needed:
•	Testes solution
•	15 ml falcon tube
•	4C refrigerator 

### Procedure:

1.	Dissect testes (see Stickleback crossing SOP).
2.	Place testes in 15 ml tube with ~ 10 ml of testes solution. 
3.	Label tube with stock number and date of testes dissection and place tube with testes in 4C refrigerator. 
4.	Change testes solution once per week. 

Note: Testes can be used up to ~ 1 month when stored this way.

## Egg Storage
(created by M Currey, August 25, 2011, updated 151201 by mcc)

### Purpose: Storage of eggs for fertilization up to 24 hours post stripping. 
Materials needed:
•	NaCl
•	KCl
•	CaCl2
•	NaHCO3
•	Tris, pH 7.2
•	npH2O
•	Streptomycin & Penicillin  Solution (PenStrep) from Sigma (P-0906) Stock – 100%
•	50 ml sterile polypropylene conical tubes
•	90 mm petri dish

### Procedure:

1.  Make stock of Holtfreiter’s Solution, store at 4C

      Mix solids into 750ml of npH2O
	3.5 gm NaCl
	0.05 gm KCl
	0.1 gm CaCl2
	0.02 gm NaHCO3
	1.0 ml Tris
	Bring to 1 liter with npH2O

2.  Add PenStrep to a final concentration of 1% (10ml into 1 liter), store at 4C.

3. Strip eggs from ripe female into a conical tube with 25ml cold Holtfreiters.

4. Eggs can be transported on ice and fertilized up to 24 hours later (maybe longer).

5. To fertilize, move eggs to 90mm petri dish and allow temperature to equilibrate to 20C.

6. Remove Holtfreiter’s solution, and rinse eggs once with embryo medium (important to.
     make sure that salt concentration is low enough for sperm to be optimally activated).

7.  Add macerated testis as in general husbandry SOP and cover eggs with embryo medium.

## Stickleback Crossing 
(Created 4/1/08 by M. Currey)
### Materials Needed: 
•	25, 45 and 90mm disposable sterile petri dishes (standard)
•	Sterile Ginzburg’s Fish Ringers solution containing antibiotic and antimycotics for testes (see Testes Solution recipe)
•	MS222 Tricaine Methanesulfonate (see Mesab recipe)
•	100% ethanol
•	Fine scissors and forceps
•	Wide-blade entomology forceps
•	Sterile Embryo medium (6ml of Instant Ocean into 1L npH2O) 
•	Squeeze wash bottles
•	Stress coat (standard from pet store)
•	Sterile flat razor blades
•	Sterile disposable large bore transfer pipettes (VWR cat# 691)
•	Dissecting microscope

1.	Squeeze Female: Cover fingers with stress coat and gently squeeze gravid female. Gravid females have extended abdomens and their eggs have “dropped”.  If eggs do not emerge with very slight pressure the female is not quite ready. Squeeze eggs with motion from pectoral girdle posterior to the cloaca into a 25mm sterile petri dish. The small size of petri dish allows the sperm to be concentrated on the eggs. 
2.	Dissect Testes From Male: Euthanize male by placing him into a finger bowl of embryo medium containing a lethal volume of MS222. Clean a large, 30cm by 60cm or similar size, glass sheet, fine scissors, and forceps with 100% ethanol. When male is motionless, remove and rinse fish with clean water and sever spinal cord behind skull using a razor to be sure of euthanization. Use scissors to make incision just posterior to the cloaca and cut from there anteriorly to the pelvic girdle making an incision along the mid line of the fish. Make another cut to each side of the fish from the cloaca dorsally approximately 15mm so that the body cavity is easily accessed. Incisions should be made just deep enough to cut the skin and body wall muscle while being wary to not cut into the stomach and intestines that are located just below the skin surface. Locate paired testes and vas deferens (testes are variable in shape and coloration, but are usually long and pigmented, usually having the same pigmentation as the skin surface, and sit in the dorsal part of the coelom near the kidneys. The vas deferens are threadlike and are usually as long as the testis to which it connects. Use fine forceps to grab vas deferens, sever near the cloaca, and remove one (or often) both testes. Doing so keeps the testes intact, allowing them to contain viable sperm for up to 1 month at 4°C in Testes Solution. 
3.	Storing of Testes: If only a single cross is to be made with a male, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, place testes into 45mm petri dish filled with cold Testes Solution. Store testes at 4°C. To store testes for extended periods, change out medium once a week. 
4.	Prepare Testis: If multiple crosses are to be performed from a single pair of male’s testes, remove one testis and place on the inside lid of the 25mm petri dish into which a females eggs have been squeezed. Using a sterile razor, slice off a small piece of testis (we’ve found a large testis can be used to fertilize approximately 5 clutches). Make cuts as perpendicular as possible to the major axis of the testis and perform multiple cuts from the same end. This allows as much of the sperm to remain packaged and inactivated at the center of the testis. Use blade to macerate testis. Under a dissecting scope swimming sperm should cause a ‘sparkling’ refraction. Add approximately 1.0 ml of sterile embryo medium to testis prep with disposable pipette, mix, and then add to the eggs one drop at a time, using same disposable pipette, dispersing drops between petri dishes so that all eggs are covered with sperm mixture. 
5.	Fertilization (time = 0): Fertilization of most eggs will occur almost instantaneously. However, I leave the sperm on the eggs for about 5-10 minutes. At this point cover embryos with embryo medium. Mark fertilization time (this is the time that the initial drops of sperm were added) on the surface of the petri dish. Place in incubator at 20°C.
6.	Separation of Embryos and Second Cleaning (t = 2 hr): The animal pole of the embryo is established at the site of sperm entry, and at 20°C the first cell syncitium is usually visible within 45 minutes. The first cell division usually occurs approximately 25 minutes later, and the two cell stage is fully visible approximately 1.5hr after fertilization. During this time, the chorion thickens and attaches to the petri dish as well as to other embryos. At or after 2 hours post fertilization, use the wide blade entomological forceps to detach the embryos from one another, as well as to dislodge embryos from the bottom of the petri dish. Remove all of the unfertilized eggs to limit mold contamination, and record the total number of eggs and embryos. Rinse embryos 3 to 4 more times then distribute embryos to 90mm petri dishes (30-50 embryos per dish) filled half way with fresh embryo medium. Enter cross information into database, print labels for dishes, and place embryos into incubator at 20°C. 
7.	Raise Embryos (check daily): Embryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time [see http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html], and hatch at approximately 7 days. 48hr stickleback embryos have completed most major morphogenetic processes, and the melanic pigment cells are just starting to migrate. A beating heart can be seen after ~72hr. Check petri dishes daily and remove those that have arrested development. A change of embryo medium may help at some point during the first 7 days as water quality may decline.

## Incubator Use and Care of Stickleback Fry
(Created 4/1/08 by M. Currey)

### Purpose:
Researchers are responsible for monitoring and caring of their research animals while in the incubator. This includes water changes, removing “deads”, fixing, euthanizing and any other procedures regarding the fish. If the fish are to be raised past hatching please contact Mark, prior to hatching, to make arrangements for putting fish into system. Also, please see Mark prior to initial use of incubator for brief training. 

### Materials needed:
•	Petri Dishes 
•	Embryo Medium (found above incubator)
•	Incubator
•	Fry food
•	checklist

###  Procedure:
Raise Embryos (check daily):
Embryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time [see http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html], and hatch at approximately 7 days. 48hr stickleback embryos have completed most major morphogenetic processes, and the melanic pigment cells are just starting to migrate. A beating heart can be seen after ~72hr. Check petri dishes daily and remove deads and those with arrested development. A change of embryo medium may help at some point during the first 7 days as water quality may decline.

Hatching, Begin Feeding Brine Shrimp, and Move to System (t = 7-8 days post fertilization): After hatching at 7-8 days post fertilization, remove chorions and allow young to absorb yolk (2-3 days). At approximately day 2 post hatching take petri dish containing fry out of incubator and place dishes on a table. To each petri dish add approximately the same volume of system water, as there is embryo medium; this will double the volume of liquid in the dish. This acclimates the fry to the system water. Allow the fry to acclimate for 6-10 hours, the longer the better. Then transfer fry to small aquaria on the system. Feed newly hatched brine shrimp once daily and fry food once daily according to directions posted in the fish room.

•	Initial checklist and add what type of check was done to checklist.

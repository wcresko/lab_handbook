## Stickleback Feeding Protocol {#sec-feeding-protocol}

::: {.callout-note}
Created May 6, 2008 by M Currey, revised October 21, 2014 by mcc
:::

### Materials

- Fish food mix or dry fry food
- Decapsulated Artemia (see @sec-artemia-decapsulation)
- Color coded feeding spoon

### Fish Foods by Life Stage {#sec-food-types}

**Fry:**

- Newly hatched baby brine shrimp (see @sec-hatching-brine-shrimp)
- Zeigler Larval Diet (Larva "Z" Plus 250-450 Microns)

**Juvenile and Adult:**

- Fish food mix (see @sec-fish-food-mix)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Storage

Dry foods are stored in freezer in the stickleback facility
:::

### Feeding Procedure

**Fry (located along the south wall of the summer room):**

- **AM feeding**: Feed fry once per day with newly hatched brine shrimp (this should happen during the opposite feeding of larval diet)
- **PM feeding**: Feed fry once per day with Zeigler larval diet 1/8 spoon full

**Juveniles and Adults:**

Located in the 20 gallon tanks in the Summer and Winter rooms. Additionally, individualized adults are sometimes located on the fry rack in the Summer room.

::: {.callout-note}
Please check white board for notification of adults on fry rack.
:::

- Feed juveniles and adults **twice per day** with dry food mix
- Use the color coding on spoon, food mix, and tags on tanks (e.g., for adults: use the red spoon, red food mix, and feed the tanks with a red tag)
- Unused brine shrimp can be fed to juvenile and adult fish

**Documentation:**

- Initial daily check list after you have fed

For food storage information, see @sec-food-storage.

## Hatching and Feeding Brine Shrimp {#sec-hatching-brine-shrimp}

::: {.callout-note}
Created by M Currey 5/6/08, updated 151201 by mcc
:::

### Materials Needed

- De-capsulated Brine Shrimp
- Rock Salt
- 105 μm mesh shrimp collector
- Baking Soda
- Squirt Bottle

### Procedure

**1. Collect Brine Shrimp:**

Drain entire cone into 105 μm mesh shrimp collector (located on shelf near cone). Rinse and pour shrimp into squirt bottle. Feed fish. Rinse squirt bottle and place on shelf to dry.

**2. Reset Brine Cone:**

1. Fill cone with DI water to 10 L
2. Put airline and heater (set at 80°F) into cone
3. Add 300 ml of rock salt and 1 scoop (5 ml) of baking soda
4. Obtain de-capsulated brine from refrigerator and shake to homogenize solution
5. Measure out 150 ml* of de-capsulated brine and add it to the cone

**3. Wait 24 hours and repeat…**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Adjusting Brine Shrimp Production

*The amount of brine shrimp needed will vary depending on the number of juvenile fish that need to be fed. If there is a need for more brine shrimp add more de-capsulated brine to cone and leave a note for the next person. Increase the amount in 50 ml increments.*

## Artemia Decapsulation {#sec-artemia-decapsulation}

::: {.callout-note}
Adapted by M Currey 4/3/08, updated 151201 by mcc
:::

### Materials

- 15 oz can of dried Artemia cysts (approximately 430 g)
- 4.3 L ~6% laundry grade bleach
- Rock Salt (NaCl)
- 125 ml 40% Lye (NaOH) solution
- 30.0 g Sodium thiosulfate (Na₂S₂O₃)
- 16 L Hatching Cone with aeration
- 125 μm mesh bag (Aquatic Eco-Systems PMB3, 125 micron x 18")
- Several 3-5 L beakers
- (1-2) Squirt bottles - squeeze type

### Solutions

::: {.callout-important}
## Prepare in Advance

Solutions should be prepared in advance
:::

**Bleach**: ~6% laundry grade

**25 ppt Salt Solution:**

1. Combine: 50 g Rock Salt (NaCl) to 2.0 L with tap water
2. Stir to dissolve completely

**40% Lye (NaOH) solution:**

::: {.callout-warning}
## Caustic Chemical

Lye is highly caustic. Follow all safety protocols from @sec-lab-safety when handling.
:::

1. Combine: 200 g Lye (NaOH) to 500 mL with tap water
2. Stir to dissolve completely
3. Store in refrigerator (4°C)

**Buffered Salt Solution:**

1. Combine: 2L, 25 ppt Salt Solution
2. 125 mL 40% Lye Solution, pre-chilled to 4°C

**1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate:**

1. Combine: 30 g sodium thiosulfate to 3.0 L with tap water
2. Stir to dissolve

**Saturated Brine:**

1. Combine: ~25g Rock Salt to 4.0 L with tap water
2. Aerate to dissolve

### Procedure

**1. Cyst Hydration:**

Hydrate one full can of dried cyst in 5 L of tap water in a hatching cone with aeration for 1 hour at room temp.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Checking Hydration

Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts **must** be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step.

If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min.
:::

**2. Filter and Rinse Cysts:**

Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 µm mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water.

**3. Transfer Cysts Back to the Cone:**

Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone.

**4. De-capsulation:**

Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange.

::: {.callout-important}
## Critical Timing

When the cysts are **90% orange**, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 µm mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water.
:::

**5. Neutralization of Residual Chlorine:**

To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear.

**6. Dehydration for Long-term Storage:**

1. Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved
2. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200-300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added
3. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine
4. Store in refrigerator

::: {.callout-note}
The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month. Hatch brine as you would capsulated brine (see @sec-hatching-brine-shrimp).

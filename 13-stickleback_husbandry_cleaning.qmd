## 20 Gallon Tank Cleaning {#sec-tank-cleaning}

::: {.callout-note}
Created April 8, 2008 by M. Currey, revised March 3, 2012 by M. Currey
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Timing Restriction

**Tank cleaning is to be done ONLY during the week**
:::

### Materials Needed

- Household bleach in a squirt bottle
- Scrub pad or sponge
- Siphon tip
- Siphon hose
- Portable waste water collector
- Scrubber pads
- Scrubber handles
- Cart (you may or may not want to use)
- Old clothes (this can be messy)
- Personal protection equipment (Splash proof glasses or face shield)

### Procedure

**1. Siphoning (cleaning by "vacuuming"):**

1. Attach siphon tip onto siphon hose. The siphon tips, which are attached to the hoses, are the only parts of this apparatus that can be immersed in the tank
2. Start siphon by running system water into hose until hose is filled with water. Turn valve so that water is "trapped" in hose
3. Put end of tip into tank that is being cleaned and turn valve back on creating a siphon
4. Vacuum all waste off of the bottom being careful to not suck up any fish

::: {.callout-important}
## Sterilization

Use each tip in only one tank and then sterilize it by washing in the dishwasher (see @sec-dishwasher).
:::

**2. Scrubbing (removal of algae from sides, front, and back of tank):**

This is done on an "as needed" basis.

::: {.callout-tip}
If you can't see into the tank, it's past time to scrub.
:::

1. With a Scotch Brite Pad (United Grocers, Eugene, Oregon) scrub front and sides of tank
2. Do not use pad on multiple tanks
3. Autoclave scrubber pads to sterilize

**3. Replace basket of bulkhead:**

1. Take the dirty basket off and sterilize in dishwasher as described in @sec-dishwasher
2. Obtain clean basket and replace

::: {.callout-warning}
## Eye Protection Required

When using bleach and/or sodium thiosulfate, eye protection is required. Please use splash proof glasses or a face shield when using bleach and sodium thiosulfate.
:::

**4. Complete bleaching and cleaning of tank:**

::: {.callout-note}
This needs to be done to each tank every 2 months.
:::

**Procedure:**

1. Remove fish from tank and put them into a clean tank
2. Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced
3. Drain the tank and remove it from the rack
4. Clean all parts with brushes and a scrub pad or put into the bleach bin
5. Clean the tank thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside

::: {.callout-important}
Algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it.
:::

6. Squirt about 10–20 mls of bleach into the tank. Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand, using a pad, sponge, tank back, or other means to expose all inside portions of the tank to bleach
7. Rinse the tank thoroughly with hot tap water
8. Rinse the tank with sodium thiosulfate, and then rinse it again with hot water
9. Put a few thiosulfate crystals into the tank and leave it
10. Reassemble the tank and put it back on the rack
11. Fill with system water and allow water to recirculate for about 30 minutes before adding fish

::: {.callout-warning}
## Monitor Fish

Watch fish for 15 min to look for any signs of distress.

## Corner Filter Cleaning {#sec-corner-filter-cleaning}

### Procedure

**1. Initial Rinse:**

Remove dirty corner filters from tanks and rinse with tap water to remove excess algae and debris.

**2. Bleach Soak:**

Put corner filters inside bleach tank and leave them soaking overnight.

**3. Rinse and Neutralize:**

1. Rinse the corner filters with hot water for 5 min being sure to fill and dump the filter with water at least 5 times
2. Place them into the sodium thiosulfate tank
3. Rinse out with the sodium thiosulfate solution 2 times and leave them to soak overnight

**4. Final Rinse:**

1. Rinse the corner filters for 5 minutes repeating the fill and dump method as above with hot water
2. Leave them drying on the rack overnight

**5. Monitor Upon Replacement:**

::: {.callout-warning}
When cleaned corner filters are placed back into aquaria, observe fish for 15 min for signs of distress.

## Fry Tank Cleaning {#sec-fry-tank-cleaning}

::: {.callout-note}
Created 4/10/08 by M Currey
:::

Fish put into fry tanks will live in these tanks for 2-3 months at which point the tank will be emptied and sterilized using the dishwasher then stored for further use.

::: {.callout-tip}
If the fry remain in these tanks for longer than 3 months, or there is a build-up of waste or algae in the tanks, then follow the following procedure.
:::

### Materials Needed

- 2.8 L or 9.5 L Aquaneering tanks
- Matching lid
- Fry baffle

::: {.callout-note}
When placing new fish into the system use 400 micron (smaller) mesh baffles.
:::

### Procedure

1. Obtain clean fry tank and install lid and baffle
2. Put fish from dirty tank into clean tank. To do this remove dirty fish tank from rack and carefully pour off 1/3 of tank water
3. Then pour the rest of the water and fish into clean tank

::: {.callout-tip}
If there is lots of waste in the tank transfer fish with a net, leaving waste in dirty tank.
:::

4. Put clean tank of fish back on rack and start water

## Dishwasher Use to Sterilize Plastics and Glassware {#sec-dishwasher}

::: {.callout-note}
Created 4/2016 by J. Crandall
:::

### Loading the Dishwasher

::: {.callout-important}
## Pre-Cleaning Required

**RINSE ALL DIRTY DISHES VERY WELL**, especially those with algae/food residue. The dishwasher will sanitize, but will not effectively clean, the dishes. Scrub dishes with a scrub pad to remove buildup, if needed.
:::

**General Loading Instructions:**

1. If there are clean dishes from a previous cycle, put them away in their respective locations. If some are still wet, set them out to dry on the drying rack before putting them away
2. Tank tube and bulkhead pieces should be hung on the vertical rinsing pipes on the bottom rack
3. Longer tank tubes should be placed on the top rack if they would impede the rinser on the bottom of the top rack from spinning
4. Small tank lids should be stacked on the bottom rack, but not on the raised portion of the rack, as this impedes the rinser from spinning properly
5. Plastic tanks, Ziploc containers and long tank tubes should be placed on the top rack

::: {.callout-warning}
## BEFORE RUNNING THE DISHWASHER

**SLIDE BOTH RACKS IN AND MAKE SURE THE RINSER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP RACK CAN SPIN FREELY**
:::

### Running the Dishwasher

**Procedure:**

1. Add ~1/2 scoop of dish detergent (found under the sink) to the well in the door of the dishwasher. Close the lid to the well
2. Close and latch the door to the dishwasher. The display will light up, and after booting up it should read "User 1"
3. Press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle

::: {.callout-tip}
## Troubleshooting Display

- If it displays a list of programs, use the down arrow key to navigate down the list to "User 1." When the "User 1" program is highlighted, press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle
- If the screen displays something other than "User 1," press the DISPLAY button to show the list of programs, scroll down to "User 1," and press RUN/CANCEL
:::

**To Cancel Mid-Cycle:**

Should the program ever need to be cancelled mid-cycle, pressing the RUN/CANCEL button once will result in the cycle canceling and the water draining.

### Large Tank Lids

- The small frontal lids to the large glass tanks should be loaded into the dishwasher
- The large lids to the large glass tanks should be hosed off thoroughly with very hot water, and set on the rack to dry

## Embryo Medium {#sec-embryo-medium}

### Materials Needed

- Instant Ocean Salt
- Baking Soda
- npH₂O

### Embryo Medium Solution Recipe

1. Add 8 g Instant Ocean to 2 liters of npH₂O
2. Add ~0.5 g baking soda
3. Check pH and adjust to 7.0 – 8.0
4. This makes 2 liters

::: {.callout-note}
## Storage

Salt and baking soda are located in containers near the dissecting scope. Rinse 2 liter flasks with DI water between uses.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Usage

This solution is used for:

- Crossing protocols (see @sec-crossing-protocol)
- Raising embryos (see @sec-incubator-use)
- Embryo bleaching (see @sec-embryo-bleaching)

## MESAB (MS-222, Tricaine) {#sec-mesab-recipe}

::: {.callout-important}
## Pharmaceutical Grade Required

**Tricaine must be pharmaceutical-grade.** We use tricaine purchased from Pentair, manufactured by Western Chemical and FDA approved.

Tricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester also called ethyl m-aminobenzoate) comes in a powdered form. **Purchase the smallest amount possible because tricaine expires quickly.**
:::

### Materials Needed

- Mesab, a.k.a. MS222, tricaine, or 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester
- 1 M Tris (pH 9)
- DD water

### MESAB Stock Solution (4g/L) - Tris Buffered {#sec-mesab-stock-recipe}

**Recipe:**

- 4 g tricaine powder
- 979 ml DD water
- ~21 ml 1 M Tris (pH 9)
- Adjust pH to ~7

**Storage:**

1. Aliquot in 50 ml tubes
2. Label with "MESAB Stock Solution 4g/L"
3. Store in a -20°C freezer
4. This makes 1 liter of solution

### Euthanasia Solution (300 mg/L) {#sec-euthanasia-solution}

1. Make a solution of tris buffered Stock Solution as described in @sec-mesab-stock-recipe (or obtain an aliquot from the freezer)
2. Combine 7.5 ml of stock solution into 100 ml of fish water

::: {.callout-note}
For full euthanasia protocol, see @sec-euthanasia.
:::

### Anesthesia Solution (168 mg/L) {#sec-anesthesia-solution}

1. Make a solution of tris buffered Stock Solution as described in @sec-mesab-stock-recipe (or obtain an aliquot from the freezer)
2. Combine 4.2 ml of stock solution into 100 ml of fish water

::: {.callout-note}
For full anesthesia protocol, see @sec-anesthesia.

## Testes Storage Solution {#sec-testes-solution}

### Materials Needed

- NaCl
- KCl
- CaCl₂
- NaHCO₃
- npH₂O
- Gentamycin (antimycotic) (Stock – 10 mg/ml)*
- Cell Culture anti-biotic/mycotic from Gibco-BRL (15240-096) 100x Concentration*

::: {.callout-note}
## Reagent Location

*Both of these reagents are located in separate boxes in Mark's space in the -20°C freezer. They are partitioned into 100 μl aliquots.

### Ginzberg's Ringers Recipe

**Preparation:**

Mix solids into 750 ml of npH₂O:

- 6.6 g NaCl
- 0.25 g KCl
- 0.3 g CaCl₂
- 0.2 g NaHCO₃

Bring to 1 liter total volume with npH₂O.

**Storage**: Store at 4°C

### Testes Solution (100 ml)

1. Add 100 μl of Gentamycin and 100 μl of Anti-biotic/mycotic to 100 ml of Ginzburg's Ringers solution
2. Store at 4°C

::: {.callout-tip}
## Usage

This solution is used for testes storage as described in @sec-testes-storage.

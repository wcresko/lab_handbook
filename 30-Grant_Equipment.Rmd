## CRESKO RESEARCH LABORATORY: 

### LABORATORY:	

The Cresko research group occupies one main lab (1050 sq. ft.), an adjacent stickleback aquatic facility (690 sq. ft.), and a shared fluorescence microscopy room, all on the third floor of Pacific Hall. On the same and adjoining floors, and contiguous with our space, are nine other labs studying evolutionary genetics The Cresko research group occupies one main lab (1050 sq. ft.), a cell culture facility with sterile hood (225 sq. ft.), an adjacent stickleback aquatic facility (690sq. ft.), and a shared fluorescence microscopy room, all on the third floor of Pacific Hall. 

### COLLEAGUES: 

One of the most important resources is colleagues. The P.I.'s lab is adjacent to labs of six other evolutionary geneticists: N. Singh (evolutionary genomics in Drosophila), B. Bohannan (bacterial evolution), W. Bradshaw (genetic basis of evolutionary change in *W. Smithii*), M. Barber (protein evolution), K. McGuire (tropical ecology), P. Phillips (evolutionary genetics using Caenorhabditis), P. Ralph (population genomics), M.Streisfeld (evolutionary genetics of Mimulus), and also John Conery (computational biology of gene and genome evolution). In addition, the Institutes of Molecular Biology (IMB) and Neuroscience (ION) contain numerous researchers with particular interest in the evolution and developmental mechanisms, including K. Guillemin (host-bacterial co-evolution), E. Johnson (genomics of stress response systems), C. Kimmel (developmental genetics), J. Postlethwait (genome evolution), J. Eisen (host-microbe developmental interactions), R. Parthasarathy (live imaging of host-microbe interactions), A. Powell (genomics and tissue modeling in gut development), and T. Ursell (cell mechanics, behavior, modeling). Monday morning research meetings, Monday IE2 seminars and META center meetings, Tuesday IMB and Thursday ION seminars, Wednesday IE2 tea time, Friday evo-devo biology and META center journal club meetings, and encounters in the hall all bring us and our students in frequent contact with one another.

### OFFICES: 

Dr. Cresko’s office (200 sq. ft.) is on the same hall as the lab and stickleback facility. Key personnel have dedicated desk space in the laboratory or adjoining offices.

### Computer

The Cresko Lab has several Macintosh, Windows and Linux computers, including a dedicated computer cluster (48 cores, 541GB of memory, 67TB local general purpose storage in a hardware RAID60 configuration, 64TB local backup storage in two hardware RAID6 configurations) for analyzing large data sets. All computers are networked to the university system via 100G connections. The Cresko Lab also hosts several community accessible services: an installation of OMERO image server (at http://omero.uoregon.edu) serves as a repository of cross-referenced stickleback microsopy images for the Cresko Lab and collaborators; the Metagenomics online database (http://metagenomics.uoregon.edu/metagenomicsdb), which was developed in house to serve the Microbial Ecology and Theory of Animals (META) Center for Systems Biology (http://meta.uoregon.edu/); the Stickleback Database (http://sticklebackdb.uoregon.edu:8080/sticklebackdb/) was developed in house to track stickleback crosses and collections from the wild; and RNA-seqlopedia (http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu) was written by the Cresko Lab and provides an overview of RNA-seq and of the experimental design choices necessary to carry out a successful RNA-seq project. 

### ANIMAL: 
The Cresko Lab operates a newly renovated stickleback aquatic facility (690 sq. ft.) capable of housing up to 4000 adult fish and 144 individualized genetic crosses, and contains experiment space specially designed for microscopy and microinjection of embryos for CRISPR, and production of gnotobiotic stickleback (i.e., fish with experimenter-defined microbial communities, including fish with no microbes, or with one or more microbial strains). The facility is managed by Mark Currey (senior research assistant), who designed and maintains the husbandry systems and databases, and directs a staff of animal care technicians. The facility, located in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution adjacent to the Cresko Lab, is completely enclosed allowing for the care and maintenance of multiple lines of stickleback that have been derived from natural populations. Most of these lines have been in continuous culture since 2003 with current stocks representing over 12 generations in the facility. Two of the rooms are used to house animals and each room is outfitted with a dedicated recirculating aquaculture system. Lighting in these rooms is manipulated so that one room is set up for a summer lighting regime and the other a winter lighting regime. These lighting regimes allow for the conditioning of the fish to breed (summer regime) and for growing the fish from fry to adults (winter regime). These facilities allow for the ability to perform specific crosses in a controlled environment at precise times so that development can be standardized and quantified. The third room is used for experiments, and to store and prepare food and husbandry supplies. Half of this room is dedicated for experimental manipulations such as the microinjection procedures of CRISPR or for generating gnotobiotic fish. This is one of several model fish facilities at the University of Oregon, and helps maintain compliance for the university’s AAALAC accreditation. UO, known as the birthplace of zebrafish research, has a full-time staffed zebrafish facility (see Aquatic Animal Care Services). Expertise in fish husbandry gathered by developing the zebrafish system at Oregon augments and supports the successful husbandry of stickleback.

### Equipment 

Microscopes (fluorescent, compound, dissecting, confocal), centrifuges, sonication and bead beating apparatus, cold rooms, freezers, thermocyclers, spectrophotometers and fluorometers, -80C and liquid nitrogen freezers, and other equipment are either in our lab or available nearby as shared equipment. The Cresko Lab has an Arcturus Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) microscope that has both an Infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) laser that can be used to ablate or to capture microdissected tissues or small numbers of cells, from fixed sections for downstream DNA and RNA analyses.  The Cresko Lab’s stickleback facility houses equipment for performing transgenic and gene knockout experiments: a microinjection needle puller and two microinjection systems, including dissection microscopes, micromanipulators, and electronic pressure injection controller.

### COMPUTERS: 
**The Cresko Lab** has several Macintosh, Windows and Linux computers, including a dedicated computer cluster (48 cores, 541GB of memory, 67TB local general purpose storage in a hardware RAID60 configuration, 64TB local backup storage in two hardware RAID6 configurations) for analyzing large data sets. All computers are networked to the university system via 100G connections. The Cresko laboratory also has a laboratory account on Talapas, UO’s top 500 computer cluster (see RACS below). 


**Servers**: PSI’s primary data storage is held on an enterprise-grade 60TB, highly available, RAID 6 array configuration. Data backups are performed each evening. For usage and processing of data, PSI maintains several available workstations with ample software, from word processing to statistical programs. The PSI servers are port-restricted from the rest of the UO network using high-end network firewall appliances and are accessible only through secure means. All data files are protected by a strict access control rules, and access is provided to only a small group of trusted users who require it, thus reducing the exposure of sensitive data. If further data-security is needed, PSI has a special securely-encrypted storage area that has further restrictions in place to prevent any unauthorized data transmissions. 


**Zoom**: UO faculty members, staff, and students have access to Zoom videoconferencing services. For UO Zoom users who handle HIPAA-regulated data, a HIPAA-compliant environment is available that includes Zoom, which establishes strict access control rules and strong AES256 encryption to prevent transmission of any PHI (protected health information). 

**VPN**: PSI and Cresko lab faculty and staff have access to a VPN connection, when off campus, to servers. The VPN utilizes Cisco AnyConnect platform and is secured with end-to-end strong AES256, and then TLS1.2 for any key exchange or authentication. VPN Users are placed into a specific network pool that is then further port restricted from any critical systems. This gives VPN users the benefit of still being able to access their data, where allowed, but prevents VPN users from accessing any critical administration items or underlying infrastructure. 

**Workstations**: PSI has made available workstation and laptops available to its faculty and staff, so as to allow them to continue their work confidently and securely. All PSI-owned workstations are security controlled through a strong set of policies and authentication mechanisms that maintain security for the workstation when interfacing with PSI servers. Drive and transport encryption is employed on the workstations,

### Aquatic Animal Care Services: 

This service, directed by Timothy Mason, provides cutting edge animal husbandry and experimental expertise for working with aquatic animals. The facility maintains housing and veterinary care for zebrafish stocks with a capacity of more than a million fish, husbandry training, and cryopreservation of sperm, and provides experiment rooms for microinjection and other research activities. UO is the birthplace of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model vertebrate, having been pioneered by Dr. George Streisinger in the 1970s. The amassed expertise in zebrafish at this facility and in the many UO research labs it serves has greatly facilitated the development of other emerging aquatic models at the UO, including threespine stickleback and spotted gar.

### Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC): 

ZIRC, co-directed by Zoltan Varga and Monte Westerfield, is across the street from our lab, and it provides the world’s central repository for wild-type and mutant strains of zebrafish and for materials and information about zebrafish research. They distribute materials and zebrafish strains to the international research community. ZIRC provides pathology services for potentially diseased fish, including those from the Cresko Lab stickleback facility. 

### Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) (http://zfin.org): 

ZFIN is an online digital resource that contains and distributes information about zebrafish research to the world. These resources include information about zebrafish genetics, genomics, and development, among many other things. ZFIN also provides a clearing house for information on researchers to encourage collaboration networks. Having this vast repository of information and tools for fish developmental genetics easily accessible greatly enhances our ability to perform evolutionary developmental analysis. 

### Biological Imaging Core: 

This facility brings together specialty microscopes including light sheet, laser capture microdissection, confocals, and the expertise needed to effectively use them. These resources will be critical in the three-dimensional visualization and documentation of transgene expression in living sticklebacks, as well as observation of living microbial endosymbionts in the stickleback gut. The light sheet microscope has already proven itself for studying interactions of microbes in the gut of living zebrafish larvae here at UO, and we will be able to adapt these methodologies to using stickleback larvae.

### Histology and Genetic Modification Core Facility: 

This facility, directed by Dr. Ute Hostick, offers cryo-, paraffin and plastic sectioning, and histological staining. These services will be useful for phenotyping of mutant stickleback strains, when characterization by in situ hybridization on cryosectioned tissue or histological staining of fixed, sectioned tissue is required. This cutting edge facility also provides many procedures for generating and strain storage of genetically modified mice, including pronuclear injection, embryo cryopreservation stem cell tissue culture and genotyping.

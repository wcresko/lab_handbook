(created by M Currey, September 10, 2012)

Materials:
1.	Minnow Traps
2.	95% ETOH
3.	Mesab (see fish Euthanasia SOP)
4.	Field Notebook
5.	500 and 1000ml Nalgene bottles
6.	Bucket
7.	Net
8.	Mouse cage
9.	Gloves
10.	Crossing materials (see stickleback crossing SOP)
Optional: 
11.	Waders
12.	Kayak


Minnow trap collecting:

**Care should be taken when setting traps in tidally influenced waters as traps that are set above the low water line have the potential to leave fish without water resulting in fish fatality. 

1.	Place traps in areas with cover. 
2.	Tether trap to shore or other non-movable object. 
3.	Leave traps up to but not over 24 hours. Traps may need to be checked more frequently depending on the tidal influence of water body being investigated. 
4.	Pull traps looking for endangered species such as salmonids, Oregon chub, and/or Bull Trout. If an endangered species is noticed open trap under water and release all of the fish. 
5.	If no endangered species are noticed, remove trap from the water and empty contents in a bucket filled 1/3 with water from where the trapping is taking place. 
6.	Remove, count, and record all stickleback and non-stickleback species. This will be used for ODFW reporting at the end of the year. 
7.	Record (in field notebook); collecting location, GPS coordinates, water temp, water type, water condition, substrate condition, vegetation condition, pH (if possible), D.O. (if possible), and other environmental measurements. 

Trap Disinfection: 

8.	Trap Disinfection: When trapping between watersheds or between different water bodies within a watershed that ODFW has requested that we disinfect our traps (see comments for current ODFW fish take permit) please do the following; 
a.	Let minnow traps air dry for ~ 1 week between collecting locations. 
b.	Further steps may be needed depending on the invasive species encountered. Updates will come soon. 

Euthanize and Storage of Collected Fish

   ** This should be done with fish that are to be used in phenotypic and genetic investigations. 

1.	Euthanize fish using MS222 (see Fish Euthanasia and Anesthesia SOP)
2.	Collect fish by pouring fish through a net. MS222 can be collected by pouring solution into a secondary container. 
3.	Place fish into a Nalgene container and fill with 95% ETOH. Do not fill bottle over half full with fish as fluids coming out of fish can dilute ETOH to the point that DNA/Tissue degradation can take place. 
4.	Return to lab and assign stock #. 
5.	Alternatively, euthanized fish can be flash frozen by placing in liquid nitrogen and stored in dry ice if high quality DNA is required. 

Wild crosses introduction into the lab

	Crosses fish (see stickleback crossing SOP). 
	Bleach embryos (see embryo bleaching SOP). 
	Introduce into fish system (see stickleback crossing SOP). 
	If embryos are to be fixed and used for investigation fix embryos (see Embryo and larval euthanasia SOP). 








Experimental Protocols
SOP - Live fin clipping of stickleback 
(created April 06, 2010 by M Currey)

Materials:  
•	MS-222 Anesthesia solution (see fish anesthesia and euthanasia SOP)
•	Beakers of fish water
•	Forceps and scissors
•	Bucket of ice
•	1.5ml tubes
•	Melafix (antifungal and antibacterial agent) 

Procedure:
•	To minimize fish’s exposure to MS-222, do all labeling of tubes and vials prior to fin clipping. 
 
•	Place fish in beaker containing MS-222 anesthesia dose (168 mg/L). 


•	Once the breathing of the fish slows take fish out of water and remove caudal fin with scissors and forceps. 
Note: To observe slowed breathing watch the operculum movement. This movement will slow and the fish will turn on it’s side.  

•	Place fin in labeled 1.5 ml tube on ice. 

•	Put fish into clean system water and move gently to force water over gills. 


•	Once fish is revived and swimming upright, put fish into container back on the aquaculture system and add Melafix according to manufacturers recommendations. 








SOP - Live stickleback alizarin staining 
(4/6/10 by M Currey, adapted from protocol by Bonnie Ullmann.)

Materials:
•	MS-222 Anesthesia solution (see fish anesthesia and euthanasia SOP)
•	Beakers of fish water
•	Alizarin Red S (sodium alizarin sulfonate)
Solutions:
   Alizarin stock solution: 0.5g Alizarin red/100ml in sterile water (SIGMA cat# A5533 Alizarin Red S, certified). 

For 1 Liter:
1.	10 ml 1M HEPES
2.	980ml Embryo medium (Zebrafish Book, Westerfield, et al).
3.	Add 10 ml 0.5% Alizarin Stock in sterile water
       1000 ml total

For 50 ml (enough for 100mm diameter petri dish):

1.	500 µl 1 M HEPES
2.	49 ml Embryo medium
3.	Add 500 µl 0.5% Alizarin Stock in sterile water
              50 ml total

Procedures:
•	Stain 1-2 hours for larvae to overnight for adult fish in the dark. Rinse thoroughly with embryo medium. Can observe right away, but background continues to go down with time.
•	Bone fluorescence will decrease over time, so plan on imaging the same day if possible.

•	Keep fish in the dark as much as is reasonably convenient.












SOP - Embryo Injections 
(from: Zebrafish Book 4th addition chp 5)

CHAPTER 5 - CELLULAR METHODS
(Source: E. Weinberg)
This is an easy method for holding embryos while injecting DNA, lineage tracer dyes, etc., without removing their chorions. The embryos are held in wedged-shaped troughs made with a plastic mold in 1.5% agarose. Each trough can hold approximately 35 embryos (with chorions). Embryos can be aligned by gently tamping them down with forceps. Agarose is useful because pipette tips generally will not break if they accidently touch the surface. As the pipette penetrates the chorion, the embryo is forced against the rear vertical wall of the trough. The exact positioning of the pipette tip within the embryo is achieved by slight movement of the pipette with a micromanipulator or by movement of the stage.
If the pipette tip is thin and long enough, it can be withdrawn from the chorion without dragging the embryo out of the trough. A problem with thin pipettes, however, is that they lack the tensile strength to penetrate the chorion and bend when forced onto the chorion surface. Thicker pipettes do not easily slip out of the chorion, although the embryo can be held with forceps as the pipette is slowly withdrawn.
Alternatively, a plastic cover can be used to impede the withdrawal of the embryo. The plastic cover fits snugly into the indentation in the agarose created by the plastic mold. The slits in the cover can be aligned with the somewhat narrower troughs in the agarose by sliding the cover from side to side. (The width of the cover is 2.0 mm less than that of the mold allowing one to achieve the desired position for injection.) The cover is 1.0 mm thick at the border, but only 0.7 mm thick between the openings so the embryos will slide off the pipette more readily.

Making the chambers:
1. Pour approximately 20 ml of hot 1.5% agarose in embryo medium into a 100 x 15 Petri dish on a level surface. Wait until completely solidified.
2. Add an additional 20 ml of the 1.5% agarose to the dish. Set the plastic mold (teeth down) into the liquid agarose overlay, tapping to eliminate any bubbles.
3. After the agarose sets, add a small amount of medium, wrap the Petri dish in parafilm, and store in the refrigerator.

Injecting:
1.	Warm the Petri dish to the temperature you prefer for injection (embryos can tolerate 18°C for about 1 hour, and the slower division rate allows more time to inject at the 1 and 2 cell stage).
2.	Remove the plastic mold.
3.	Position the dish on a microscope stage and adjust the angle of the pipette so that you can aim directly into the trough.
4.	Transfer embryos into the troughs and set the plastic cover with slits into the depression in the agarose.
5.	Using forceps, align the embryos all in the same orientation. Add enough culture medium so that the level reaches the plastic edges of the slits. Gently tamp the embryos down into the trough.
6.	Using controls on the micromanipulator, force the pipette through the chorion and the yolk cell, entering the embryonic cell(s) from the yolk cell. (You might prefer to enter the embryonic cell directly; in this case, you would choose a different orientation of the embryo in the trough.)
7.	As the pipette goes through the yolk, move the Petri dish a bit so that the pipette is close to the plastic cover.
8.	Inject the desired volume of solution and then withdraw the pipette with a slow steady motion. The embryo will catch on the plastic cover and drop back into the trough.
9.	Transfer the embryos into a dish with embryo medium and maintain at 28.5°C for further development.
Top view and cross-section of the plastic slot maker (A) and plastic cover piece (B). All dimensions are in mm. An enlarged view of a cross-section of the teeth is shown in the lower part of panel (A). The area within the dotted lines, in the diagram of the cover piece in panel (B), is 0.7 mm thick whereas the border area outside the dotted lines is 1.0 mm thick.
Schematic cross-sectional view of the injection set-up as an embryo is injected (a) and as the pipette is withdrawn (c), and top views of an actual embryo being injected (b) and as the pipette is withdrawn (d). Arrows in (a) and (c) indicate the direction of movement of the pipette. Arrows in (b) and (d) indicate the position of the vertical wall of the trough (the trough is difficult to see in the photograph because the agarose has low contrast; the two strong lines in each photograph are the edges of the slots).


SOP - Salinity Exposure 
(created August 8, 2011 by Ann Petersen)

Materials:
•	MS-222 Anesthesia solution (168 mg/L) (see fish anesthesia and euthanasia SOP)
•	Glass containers of fish water of varying salinity ranging from 2 - 32 ppt
•	Glass 1 gallon fish containers (not plastic due to endocrine disruptive properties)
•	Instant Ocean saltwater mix at concentrations of
•	2ppt “Freshwater” environment  (40g Instant Ocean/ 20L Nanopure H20) 
•	15ppt “Brackish” environment (300g Instant Ocean/ 20L Nanopure H20)
•	30ppt “Ocean” environment (600g Instant Ocean/ 20L Nanopure H20)
•	   Stickleback fish feeding SOP supplies (artemia, dry flakes, etc.)
•	   Stickleback fish crossing and rearing SOP supplies.

Procedure:

•	Follow stickleback crossing and rearing SOP to generate 100-200 fertilized embryos.
•	Place petri dish with fertilized eggs and embryo medium (6ppt Instant Ocean) in common 20C incubatorfor 4 hours.
•	After 4 hours, remove any embryos that are arrested or deformed. Using a transfer pipette, transfer the healthy embryos to a petri dish containing the experimental treatment, freshwater, brackish water, or ocean water.
•	Return the embryos to the 20C incubator
•	On a daily basis, check on development of embryos. Change water  every day, making sure to replace with correct salinity treatment. Remove the dead or deformed.
•	At 8 dpf, after the embryos have hatched, move them to a 1 gallon glass jar full of the appropriate salinity water.
•	On 9dpf, feed each jar enough artemia so that it is consumed by the juveniles within 15-30 minutes.
•	Feed and change water every other day. Do not overcrowd as outlined in stickleback SOP. Check on fish at least twice EVERY DAY, and use the care checklist to denote daily health check, feeding, and water change. Look for sick or stressed fish (low rate of opercular fluttering, bad color, floating upside down, etc.) 
•	Check water quality on two random tanks in each treatment once every two days before water has been changed. If ammonia and/or nitrite are detected then change water more frequently, check water quality daily, and denote this on checklist. Ideal ammonia and nitrite levels are 0 ppm.At designated time of interest up to 40 days post-fertilization, remove fish with a small clean net
•	Place fish in beaker containing MS-222 euthanasia dose (300 mg/L). 
•	Wait for fish’s operculum to stop moving, wait 10 minutes and fix.
•	Fix appropriately in liquid nitrogen, 4%PFA, or Bouin’s.
If downstream application requires instantaneous, non stressed measurement of gene transcription, remove fish from water, rapidly blot, and sacrifice directly into liquid nitrogen or RNAlater.

Purpose:
This protocol allows for visualization of proliferating cells.  EdU (5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine) is a small molecule that is incorporated into DNA during active DNA synthesis.  Detection is based on a “click reaction”, a copper-catalyzed covalent reaction between and azide and an alkyne.  
Kit purchased from Invitrogen: Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor Imaging Kit
Materials:
(Not provided in kit)
•	Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2-7.6)
•	3% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, pH 7.4
•	Deionized water
•	Embryo Medium
•	90 mm sterile petri dishes

Procedure:
EdU labeling and fixation:

1) Incubate 9-11dpf larvae for 6-8 hours in 1mM EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) in embryo medium in 90mm disposable sterile petri dishes (standard)
2) Euthanize larvae with MS-222 and fix overnight at 4C in 4% PFA (in PBS), (see embryo euthanasia and fixation protocol)
3) Wash fixed fish in PBSTx (1% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS). 
4) Prepare embryos for fluorescent in situ hybridization for probe of choice (Col10a1)

**To make the 10X stock solution: Use Click-iT EdU buffer additive (Component F)— add 2mL of nano pure water to the bottle, then mix until fully dissolved.  After the 10X solution is made, store the remaining stock solution in the -20 freezer.
2)   Prepare the 1X Click-iT reaction buffer.  Prepare from Component D (10X solution). 
      Dilute 1:10 with nanopure water
3) Prepare the Click-iT reaction cocktail.  Add reagents in the order listed:
4) Wash embryos 4 x 3 min was in 3% BSA in PBST
5) Incubate in reaction cocktail for 1 hr in dark
6) Wash with 3% BSA/PBS in dark
7) Mount on slide with vectashield (includes DAPI in medium)

•	Change 70% of media each day.
•	At 11dpf, add an autoclaved packet of ~5g ammo-carb (Aquarium Pharmaceuticals, Inc) to the water to neutralize toxins. This packet will remain in the flask until the end of the experiment and then disposed. 
•	The Zeigler food is derived from the following reference: 
Pham, Kanther, Semova and Rawls. Nature Protocols, 2008; 3(12):1862-1875. 











SOP – Mono-associated Protocol for Stickleback
Purpose:
This protocol is used to determine whether the microbial community of one strain of stickleback can colonize the gut of another strain that is evolutionarily different. This protocol has been adapted for use in stickleback from an established, approved zebrafish protocol. 
Procedure:
The bacterial inoculums should be determined empirically for each species used.  For many bacteria 104 Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per milliliter of stickleback medium will suffice for full colonization of the intestine and minimal toxicity to the fish. Dead larvae in the flask will be removed as this will often result in increased bacterial growth that can ultimately be fatal to the remaining larvae.  The method below is used for several proteobacteria strains.  

1.	Raise fish in a germ-free environment as described.
2.	Incubate bacteria for 16 hours in 50ml of growth medium in 250 ml flask at 25°C, 200 RPM. These bacteria will originate from the intestine of a healthy stickleback to ensure that the bacteria are not pathogens.
3.	Measure the Optical Density600 (OD600) of the culture.  
4.	Calculate the original culture density, assuming 1 OD600 = 109 CFU / ml.
5.	Dilute the culture to pre-determined concentration as needed in filter sterilized stickleback medium, and inoculate flask in tissue culture hood. The fish will be exposed to the bacteria in the water after their digestive system is open and they have been shown to consume food, which occurs between 9 and 13 days post fertilization. The inoculums will be determined in a manner similar to those already established for zebrafish and used regularly in the Guillemin laboratory. Germ-free fish water is inoculated between 1000 and 1000000 bacteria per milliliter so the concentration the concentration can be chosen that results in healthy fish surviving to three days post-exposure.
6.	Plate dilutions of the original bacterial culture in order to verify the CFU/ml of the inoculum.
7.	Monitor fish daily for signs of illness, including lack of motility, response to external stimuli, rapid movement of opercular (gill) cover and any other sign of non-normal behavior. 
8.	If a dead fish is found, remove fish and place in morgue (see Sick and Dead fish SOP), record on daily checklist and alert supervisor.
9.	At the end of the experiment, euthanize fish by established and approved protocols (see approved stickleback euthanasia protocol).

SOP - Sentinel Fish Sampling
(created December 20, 2007, updated May 14th, 2008 by M Currey)

Materials: 
•	Dietrich’s fixative (see below for recipe)
•	50  ml tubes
•	Straight razor
•	Solutions
Prepare Dietrich's Fixative (100 ml) as follows:
   Mix in order:
-	30 ml Ethanol (95%)
-	10 ml Formalin (Formaldehyde 37% solution, histological grade, contains 10-  
-	15% methanol, Sigma # F1635)
-	2 ml Glacial Acetic Acid
-	58 ml Distilled Water
-	Store fixative at room temperature.

Procedure:
Sentinel tanks are placed in both the Summer and Winter rooms. One clutch of embryos is made and then divided. One half is put into the Winter room and the other is put into the Summer Room. Each tank should contain 10 –20 fish. Every 6 months four fish from each tank are samples. These fish will then be stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and sectioned and mounted on slides by the Histology lab in Huestis Hall (contact – Poh King). Prepared slides are diagnosed by U of O attending vet, Kathy Snell 

Fixing of Fish and Sectioning:
Fish are euthanized using MS222. Cut 2cm segments starting just behind the eye to 2cm caudally. Put these segments into Dietrich’s fix for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours, cut segment bi-laterally leaving the spine. This is the piece that will be sent to histology.  Parafin embedded sagital sections need to be done. Sectioning only a few slices through 
the spinal cord.

SOP - Sump Maintenance 
(created 5/21/08 by M Currey)

Materials:
•	Pool vacuum
•	Clean building water with spray nozzle

Procedure:

Sumps are to be cleaned once a month or as needed. 

1.	Remove black matted cover of biobucket and take it to the trough. 
2.	Turn on clean water and wash cover until clean. 
3.	Return to sump and install drain cap and turn off valves to tanks of that rack. 
4.	Use the pool vacuum to clean debrie from bottom of sump.  
5.	Wash front plastic of sump with sponge (if cleaning clear sumps). Close valve, remove drain plug, open valves to tanks and move to the next sump or clean up. 

















SOP - RO Maintenance
(created December 14, 2011 m currey) 


For start up and more detailed info please refer to the manual. 

Determination of run time/day:
•	Run RO unit into container with known units of volume and determine the amount of time to fill desired volume. Determine the gallon per minute flow rate. If using a liter vessel; 3.8 liters = 1 gallon. 
•	The system is ~ 2000 gallons. Ideally we will want to change 5-10% of the water each day. This is 100-200 gallons. 
•	Set timer that RO unit is plugged into so that it is on the desired amount of time using the gallons/minute rate determined in step 1. 

** On 111214 the RO flow rate is ½ gallon/3 minutes. The timer was set to come on 6 hours/day split so that the RO comes on ~ 3X for 2 hours each time. 

Maintenance: 

 

Once a month or as needed:  
1.	Change and discard the pre-filter (city supply side) 
2.	Change and discard the first carbon block filter (middle position)
3.	Move the second carbon filter (closest to the machine) to the middle position 
4.	Install new carbon block in and put a new carbon block in third position

When the prefilter clogs the system will cycle on and off as the low pressure switch turns the unit off with low pressure but as soon as flow stops the pressure rebuilds and turns it back on.  This will destroy your pump and or motor and is very bad for the contacts in the pressure switch.  

Notes on Parts:  

I get the pump from Grainger ~$120
Procon pump, membranes, prefilters and carbon blocks from Pacific RO.  http://www.pacificro.com The guy's name is Bob and his prices are significantly lower than anything else I've found.  I just place a $2k order with him yesterday.

Applied Membranes inc www.appliedmembranes.com is another source I've used.

Craig from Oregon Water treatment just stopped buy and I'm buying new units from him.  He's matching Aquatic Eco's low prices, he's local and great to work with so I'm most likely going to be shifting all my business his way.

The tw30-2526 membranes for the hp 900 water factory is now a higher producing membrane twhp30-2526.  Makes more water.

Here are a few more bits and pieces for the units:

Water supply solenoid valve (tough to get, Oregon water treatment or Paramount supply):

 





If the water won't shut off, the orifice has gone bad.  Here's the one I'm working on right now.  11 years of soft water has eaten the brass away preventing the solenoid from shutting flow off.

Bad Orifice:
 

New Orifice

SOP - UV filter bulb replacement and maintenance
(created December 14, 2011 m currey) 

Materials:
•	New UV bulbs - Stickleback system – 120 Watt
•	Gloves
•	High vacuum grease
•	Replacement Seals
•	Cloth for cleaning bulb housing
•	bucket

Bulb Replacement:

**Always wear gloves when handling UV bulbs as oils from your hands can ruin the bulb. 

•	Turn off power to UV filter 
•	Remove bulb by unscrewing plastic bulb bolt (grey threaded bolt at end of filter). 
•	Unplug bulb noting prong placement. 
•	Plug in new bulb with same prong placement as old bulb. 
•	Screw in bolt and UV. 
•	Turn power back on by plugging filter back in. 
•	Check to see that UV is working by looking for light through “viewing window” at the end of the filter. 
•	Update changed/next change needed sticker on outside of unit. 

Notes:
•	If bulb is not on it is probably because the prongs are incorrect. Take bulb back out and change the way the bulb is plugged in. 
•	Bulbs should be replaced once per year. 

Maintenance:

   ** This should be done when changing the bulb. 
1.	Isolate filter from main system by turning valves to shut off water to UV or turning off the water system. 
2.	Remove Bulb
3.	Drain UV filter by unscrewing bulb and other end caps from main housing. 
4.	Remove bulb housing and clean the outside of the hosing with a soft cloth, 
5.	Replace seals using grease on the seals. 
6.	Re-assemble bulb housing and install new bulb (see above). 
7.	Start unit and check to see that light is on and the unit is not leaking.
SOP - Carbon filter 
(created December 14, 2011 m currey) 

Backwashing:

** The black carbon filter is set to automatically backwash once every 99 days. 

For the BLACK carbon filter (Manual backwash): 
•	Press and hold up and down arrows for 4+ sec. This will initiate the manual backwash. 

For the BLUE carbon filter: 
•	Plug in filter. 
•	Twist large dial clockwise to “Backwash” position. The filter will now take itself through the backwash cycle. This takes about 30 – 40 minutes. When the cycle is done, unplug the filter. 
•	Label front of filter with time of backwash and when next backwash is needed. 

Filter Re-bed (activated carbon):
Materials: 
1.	Water hose to wash out used media
2.	Muck buckets
3.	Funnel
4.	Granular activated carbon (FilterWater.com, model #FM-GAC-01) 1 cu.
5.	Sand (Quickcrete model # 115251, coarse and washed)
6.	Duct tape

Procedure:
Disconnect Vessel
1.	Turn off water source
2.	Open valve to relieve pressure
3.	Disconnect vessel

Remove Carbon and Sand
1.	Unscrew head mechanism
2.	Position vessel on side near water hose
3.	Position muck bucket to catch media
4.	Spray water into vessel to remove carbon and sand
5.	Collect media and strain to remove water. Put used carbon into garbage sack and place in dumpster. 

Replace carbon and sand
1.	Dry top of riser and seal with duct tape
2.	Use funnel and add 4 inches of sand until top of riser is covered
3.	Add carbon to 18” below top of riser giving room for backwash mode. 

Reconnect vessel
1.	Remover duct tape. 
2.	Reconnect head control system (a little gasket grease may be needed to make a tight seal). 
3.	Reconnect vessel to plumbing
4.	Fill with water and allow it to sit overnight so that the carbon absorbs water. 
5.	Turn water on and initiate backwash cycle. 































SOP - Programming Fish Room Lighting 
(created 3-20-2008 by M Currey)

Materials: 
	PC 
	Liason software and manual

Programming of fish room lighting regimes is done using the wall unit Grafik Eye 3000 and a PC. The unit is programmed in terms of scenes. Each scene specifies a lighting event, e.g. turning on the lights in one room over a 1/2 hour time period. Scenes are set at the control unit following the directions in the manual. Four scenes have been set up to turn off or on lighting in the main room and the breeding room. 

Procedure:
Scene 1: Main room ON with 30 min dawn. 

Scene 2: Main room OFF with 30 min dusk. 

Scene 3: Breeding room ON with 30 min dawn

Scene 4:  Breeding room OFF with 30 min dusk

Once the scenes are programmed you must tell the unit when to activate the scenes. This is done with a PC and Grafik Eye Liason software. If the software needs to be installed do so.  Connect the PC to the control unit. 

In EDIT MODE, 

•	Select control unit (I think that this unit is GRX3105)
•	Go to schedule (Not program) 
•	Drag scenes (upper right box) to desired times
•	Drag control unit (lower right box) to each scene
•	Be sure and copy schedule to the weekend
•	Go to FILE and establish communications via Online Options. 
•	After communications have been established go back to edit mode
•	Go to Online Options and select transfer data. This should program the wall unit when to activate scenes. 

Emergency Procedures
SOP - Emergency Plan and Phone List

Huestis Zebrafish Facility/Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC)/Pacific Stickleback Facility Operations in Time of Crisis

Purpose:  
To describe procedures necessary for continuing fish care during a time of reduced staffing caused by a crisis, pandemic or natural catastrophe. 

Summary:
A crisis dictates that fish care is reduced to only the necessary minimum for survival and colony health.  Consequently, only reduced staff who is essential for fish care will be present in the facility.  This document details the minimal procedures required for maintaining fish alive and healthy.

Personnel Qualifications/Responsibilities:
This SOP is intended for directors, managers, and animal technicians working in fish facilities.  Persons executing procedures herein must have previous training in basic fish husbandry including feeding, tank maintenance, dead/moribund fish removal, and must have previous training in basic water system maintenance.  In addition, the various fish facilities and rooms will cross-train essential caretakers to ensure further back up of staff in the other facilities.

Equipment and Supplies:
Food, feeding utensils, tank replacement parts, clean nets, water system tools, e.g., pH meter, water system supplies, e.g., Aragonite.

Procedure:
1. Initiation of Emergency Care Program
•	As soon as the emergency situation is announced by University officials, facility directors, managers, or responsible personnel take the following steps:
•	Alert and call in a meeting with the essential staff that same day
•	Distribute this SOP to essential staff for animal care
•	Ensure that no new experiments involving live fish are started from then on
•	Ensure that fish in static tanks (e.g. fin clipped or awaiting identification) are placed back on the water system and have regular life support (running water, air etc)
•	Ensure that non-essential staff is sent home until further notice
•	An emergency check-list is provided in a central location that details job distribution and tracks execution of the minimal procedures in this SOP

2. Feeding
	• Fish of all ages, i.e., adult and larvae, are fed only once per day. 
	• Fish should receive only dry or flake-type food. 
• No live food culture is needed, however, already existing stocks of live food can be used up (e.g. paramecia cultures).

3. Tank Maintenance
	• Water and air supply to tanks must be maintained.  Check daily.
• Tank change schedules and scrub/siphon schedules are suspended or reduced to the absolute minimum: only tanks with algae growth at the front screen need to be cleaned to allow continuing system and fish checks. 

4. Dead/Moribund Fish
• Remove dead and/or moribund fish as they are discovered.  Continue standard care procedures and use a clean net for each tank.  Nets can be autoclaved, if trained personnel are available or, in dire cases, a dip in bleach can be used to sanitize nets.

5. Central Water System Maintenance
	• Maintain checks of central water system chemistry and volume.
	• Confirm monitoring equipment is properly calibrated.
• Confirm electronic monitoring, e.g., SCADA, systems are functioning and dial-out (calling) is enabled.

6. Equipment Washing
	• Wash tanks and tank parts only as needed.

IMPORTANT: Essential functions of husbandry do not include experimental procedures such as fin-clipping fish, genotyping, or crossing fish.  Any fish discovered in static water containers of any kind at the start of the crisis period will be returned to their permanent housing locations.  No resources will be devoted to supplying experimental equipment during a crisis period. 

7. Termination of Emergency Care Program
As soon as the emergency has ended University officials will notify facility directors, managers, or responsible personnel to call everybody back to work, terminate the emergency program and reinstate standard operating procedures.

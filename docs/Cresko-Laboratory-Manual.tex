\section{Authorship of Manuscripts}\label{authorship-of-manuscripts}}

\textbf{Recommended: At the start of each project, design your plan for authorship of the project so
everyone knows the expectations}

\emph{Authorship criteria}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Makes a significant intellectual contribution to research ideas and experimental design
\end{enumerate}

OR

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  Makes a significant contribution to data acquisition, data generation, data analysis, data
  interpretation, research coordination, and/or financial support of research
\end{enumerate}

AND

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Contributes to writing part of the manuscript, in addition to editing revisions before
  submission for publication
\end{enumerate}

AND

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  Remains involved throughout the submission and revision process until final publication
\end{enumerate}

*Research participants not meeting the criteria should be listed in the Acknowledgments
section of the final published manuscript

\emph{Authorship order}:

Generally, the person who had the most significant contribution to the project and who does
most of the writing will be the first author. In ecology, the last author is generally the PI of the
lab (although not always). The remaining authors are usually listed in their order of
contribution. However, if contributions were equivalent, then co-authors can be alphabetized
or ordered according to their time since involvement in the project.

Heed the ``one glove rule'': remove one glove when moving between rooms to avoid touching doorknobs with a contaminated glove. Note that glove materials differ in their permeability to different reagents. Standard nitrile gloves are adequate for our lab's standard procedures. However, if you are planning experiments that involve more dangerous reagents, consult with Luke Sitts at EHS to select appropriate gloves.

Adult brine shrimp are from a local fish store and are only available every tow weeks. They last \textasciitilde{} one week and therefore adult pipefish are fed adult brine shrimp for one week and moina the next.

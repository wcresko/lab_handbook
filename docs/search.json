This prevents misunderstandings and ensures fair recognition of contributions.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Authorship Criteria\nTo qualify as an author on a manuscript, an individual must meet ALL of the following criteria:\n\n1. Intellectual or Practical Contribution\nMakes a significant intellectual contribution to research ideas and experimental design\nOR\nMakes a significant contribution to data acquisition, data generation, data analysis, data interpretation, research coordination, and/or financial support of research\nAND\n2. Writing Contribution\nContributes to writing part of the manuscript, in addition to editing revisions before submission for publication\nAND\n3. Ongoing Involvement\nRemains involved throughout the submission and revision process until final publication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n\n\nResearch participants not meeting the authorship criteria should be listed in the Acknowledgments section of the final published manuscript. This ensures all contributors receive appropriate recognition.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Authorship Order\nThe order of authors on a manuscript typically follows these guidelines:\n\nFirst Author: The person who had the most significant contribution to the project and who does most of the writing\nLast Author: Generally the PI of the lab (although not always in ecology/evolution)\nMiddle Authors: Usually listed in order of contribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Cases\n\n\n\nIf contributions were equivalent, then co-authors can be:\n\nListed alphabetically, or\nOrdered according to their time since involvement in the project\n\nWhen using co-first authors or other non-standard arrangements, this should be explicitly stated in the manuscript.",

We use tricaine purchased from Aquatic Ecosystems, manufactured by Western Chemical and FDA approved.\nThese procedures are to be done on fish larger than 5mm in length.\n\n\n\n5.2.1 Materials Needed\n\nFish Morgue consisting of a small bucket with lid and a sealable plastic bag\nMesab, a.k.a. MS222, tricaine or 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester\nSmall container\nNet\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Mesab Stock Solution (4g/L)\nFrom Zebrafish Book 4th edition:\nTricaine (3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester also called ethyl m-aminobenzoate) comes in a powdered form from Sigma (Cat.# A-5040). It is also available as Finquel (Part No. C-FINQ-UE) from Argent Chemical Laboratories, Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\n\nMake tricaine solution for anesthetizing fish by combining the following in a glass bottle with a screw cap:\nStock Solution (4g/L):\n\n400 mg tricaine powder\n97.9 ml DD water\n~2.1 ml 1 M Tris (pH 9)\n\nAdjust pH to ~7. Store this solution in the freezer.\nBuy the smallest amount possible because tricaine degrades over time.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Euthanasia Protocol (300 mg/L)\nProcedure:\n\nMake a solution of tris buffered Stock solution MS-222 solution as described in Section 5.2.2 (or obtain solution from freezer)\nCombine 7.5 ml of stock solution into 100 ml of fish water\nPlace fish into fish water/mesab solution for at least 10 minutes after cessation of opercular movement (~12 minutes total)\nIf fish is to be used for experiments, proceed with fixation or preparation of the experiment\nIf the fish are to be disposed of, place fish into fish morgue located in chest freezer in entry room\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Anesthesia Protocol (168 mg/L)\nProcedure:\n\nMake a solution of tris buffered Stock solution MS-222 solution as described in Section 5.2.2 (or obtain solution from freezer)\nCombine 4.2 ml of stock solution into 100 ml of fish water\nPlace fish into 168 mg/L MS-222 solution and wait for the fish to slow down\nImage or do other experiments quickly to minimize fish exposure to MS-222. Pay attention to opercular movement to be sure that fish is alive\nRevive by placing in fish water and moving fish gently through the water to pass water over gills\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Liquid N₂ Freezing and Fixation in RNAlater\nProcedure:\n\nAnesthetize using concentration from Section 5.2.4 and allow fish to lay motionless with only slight opercle movement. This should take approximately 10 minutes\nPlace fish in liquid N₂ for 2 minutes. This instantaneously freezes the fish\nThaw into RNAlater-ICE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety\n\n\n\nWhen using liquid nitrogen, follow all safety protocols outlined in Section 4.4.",

Currey\n\n\n\n7.4.1 Materials Needed\n\n25, 45 and 90 mm disposable sterile petri dishes (standard)\nSterile Ginzburg’s Fish Ringers solution containing antibiotic and antimycotics for testes (see Chapter 10)\nMS222 Tricaine Methanesulfonate (see Section 5.2.2)\n100% ethanol\nFine scissors and forceps\nWide-blade entomology forceps\nSterile Embryo medium (6 ml of Instant Ocean into 1L npH₂O)\nSqueeze wash bottles\nStress coat (standard from pet store)\nSterile flat razor blades\nSterile disposable large bore transfer pipettes (VWR cat# 691)\nDissecting microscope\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Procedure\n1. Squeeze Female\nCover fingers with stress coat and gently squeeze gravid female. Gravid females have extended abdomens and their eggs have “dropped”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf eggs do not emerge with very slight pressure the female is not quite ready.\n\n\nSqueeze eggs with motion from pectoral girdle posterior to the cloaca into a 25 mm sterile petri dish. The small size of petri dish allows the sperm to be concentrated on the eggs.\n2. Dissect Testes From Male\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nFollow all safety protocols from Chapter 4 when handling sharp instruments and chemicals.\n\n\n\nEuthanize male by placing him into a finger bowl of embryo medium containing a lethal volume of MS-222\nClean a large glass sheet (30 cm × 60 cm or similar size), fine scissors, and forceps with 100% ethanol\nWhen male is motionless, remove and rinse fish with clean water and sever spinal cord behind skull using a razor to ensure euthanization\nUse scissors to make incision just posterior to the cloaca and cut from there anteriorly to the pelvic girdle making an incision along the mid line of the fish\nMake another cut to each side of the fish from the cloaca dorsally approximately 15 mm so that the body cavity is easily accessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareful Dissection\n\n\n\nIncisions should be made just deep enough to cut the skin and body wall muscle while being wary to not cut into the stomach and intestines that are located just below the skin surface.\n\n\n\nLocate paired testes and vas deferens (testes are variable in shape and coloration, but are usually long and pigmented, usually having the same pigmentation as the skin surface, and sit in the dorsal part of the coelom near the kidneys. The vas deferens are threadlike and are usually as long as the testis to which it connects)\nUse fine forceps to grab vas deferens, sever near the cloaca, and remove one (or often) both testes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDoing so keeps the testes intact, allowing them to contain viable sperm for up to 1 month at 4°C in Testes Solution.\n\n\n3. Storing of Testes\nIf only a single cross is to be made with a male, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, place testes into 45 mm petri dish filled with cold Testes Solution. Store testes at 4°C. To store testes for extended periods, change out medium once a week. See Section 7.2 for details.\n4. Prepare Testis\nIf multiple crosses are to be performed from a single pair of male’s testes, remove one testis and place on the inside lid of the 25 mm petri dish into which a female’s eggs have been squeezed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTestis Usage\n\n\n\nUsing a sterile razor, slice off a small piece of testis. We’ve found a large testis can be used to fertilize approximately 5 clutches.\nMake cuts as perpendicular as possible to the major axis of the testis and perform multiple cuts from the same end. This allows as much of the sperm to remain packaged and inactivated at the center of the testis.\n\n\n\nUse blade to macerate testis\nUnder a dissecting scope swimming sperm should cause a ‘sparkling’ refraction\nAdd approximately 1.0 ml of sterile embryo medium to testis prep with disposable pipette, mix, and then add to the eggs one drop at a time\nUse same disposable pipette, dispersing drops between petri dishes so that all eggs are covered with sperm mixture\n\n5. Fertilization (time = 0)\nFertilization of most eggs will occur almost instantaneously. However, leave the sperm on the eggs for about 5-10 minutes.\n\nAt this point cover embryos with embryo medium\nMark fertilization time (this is the time that the initial drops of sperm were added) on the surface of the petri dish\nPlace in incubator at 20°C\n\n6. Separation of Embryos and Second Cleaning (t = 2 hr)\nThe animal pole of the embryo is established at the site of sperm entry, and at 20°C the first cell syncitium is usually visible within 45 minutes. The first cell division usually occurs approximately 25 minutes later, and the two cell stage is fully visible approximately 1.5 hr after fertilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChorion Development\n\n\n\nDuring this time, the chorion thickens and attaches to the petri dish as well as to other embryos.\n\n\nAt or after 2 hours post fertilization:\n\nUse the wide blade entomological forceps to detach the embryos from one another, as well as to dislodge embryos from the bottom of the petri dish\nRemove all of the unfertilized eggs to limit mold contamination, and record the total number of eggs and embryos\nRinse embryos 3 to 4 more times then distribute embryos to 90 mm petri dishes (30-50 embryos per dish) filled half way with fresh embryo medium\nEnter cross information into database, print labels for dishes, and place embryos into incubator at 20°C\n\n7. Raise Embryos (check daily)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopmental Timeline\n\n\n\nEmbryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time (see http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html), and hatch at approximately 7 days.\nKey developmental milestones:\n\n48 hr: Most major morphogenetic processes complete, melanic pigment cells just starting to migrate\n~72 hr: Beating heart can be seen\n7-8 days: Hatching occurs\n\n\n\nDaily care:\n\nCheck petri dishes daily and remove embryos that have arrested development\nA change of embryo medium may help at some point during the first 7 days as water quality may decline",

This acclimates the fry to the system water\nAllow the fry to acclimate for 6-10 hours, the longer the better\nThen transfer fry to small aquaria on the system\nFeed newly hatched brine shrimp once daily and fry food once daily according to directions posted in the fish room\n\n\n\nDocumentation:\n\nInitial checklist and add what type of check was done to checklist",

Cyst Hydration:\nHydrate one full can of dried cyst in 5 L of tap water in a hatching cone with aeration for 1 hour at room temp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking Hydration\n\n\n\nExamine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step.\nIf cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min.\n\n\n2. Filter and Rinse Cysts:\nCollect the hydrated cyst in a 125 µm mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water.\n3. Transfer Cysts Back to the Cone:\nAdd the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone.\n4. De-capsulation:\nAdd the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCritical Timing\n\n\n\nWhen the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 µm mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water.\n\n\n5. Neutralization of Residual Chlorine:\nTo neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear.\n6. Dehydration for Long-term Storage:\n\nTransfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved\nTransfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200-300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added\nFill the bottles with de-capsulated brine\nStore in refrigerator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month. Hatch brine as you would capsulated brine (see Section 8.4).",

    "text": "9.4 Dishwasher Use to Sterilize Plastics and Glassware\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCreated 4/2016 by J. Crandall\n\n\n\n9.4.1 Loading the Dishwasher\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Cleaning Required\n\n\n\nRINSE ALL DIRTY DISHES VERY WELL, especially those with algae/food residue. The dishwasher will sanitize, but will not effectively clean, the dishes. Scrub dishes with a scrub pad to remove buildup, if needed.\n\n\nGeneral Loading Instructions:\n\nIf there are clean dishes from a previous cycle, put them away in their respective locations. If some are still wet, set them out to dry on the drying rack before putting them away\nTank tube and bulkhead pieces should be hung on the vertical rinsing pipes on the bottom rack\nLonger tank tubes should be placed on the top rack if they would impede the rinser on the bottom of the top rack from spinning\nSmall tank lids should be stacked on the bottom rack, but not on the raised portion of the rack, as this impedes the rinser from spinning properly\nPlastic tanks, Ziploc containers and long tank tubes should be placed on the top rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEFORE RUNNING THE DISHWASHER\n\n\n\nSLIDE BOTH RACKS IN AND MAKE SURE THE RINSER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP RACK CAN SPIN FREELY\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Running the Dishwasher\nProcedure:\n\nAdd ~1/2 scoop of dish detergent (found under the sink) to the well in the door of the dishwasher. Close the lid to the well\nClose and latch the door to the dishwasher. The display will light up, and after booting up it should read “User 1”\nPress the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting Display\n\n\n\n\nIf it displays a list of programs, use the down arrow key to navigate down the list to “User 1.” When the “User 1” program is highlighted, press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle\nIf the screen displays something other than “User 1,” press the DISPLAY button to show the list of programs, scroll down to “User 1,” and press RUN/CANCEL\n\n\n\nTo Cancel Mid-Cycle:\nShould the program ever need to be cancelled mid-cycle, pressing the RUN/CANCEL button once will result in the cycle canceling and the water draining.\n\n\n9.4.3 Large Tank Lids\n\nThe small frontal lids to the large glass tanks should be loaded into the dishwasher\nThe large lids to the large glass tanks should be hosed off thoroughly with very hot water, and set on the rack to dry",

Determine the gallon per minute flow rate. If using a liter vessel; 3.8 liters = 1 gallon\nThe system is ~ 2000 gallons. Ideally we will want to change 5-10% of the water each day. This is 100-200 gallons\nSet timer that RO unit is plugged into so that it is on the desired amount of time using the gallons/minute rate determined in step 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn 111214 the RO flow rate is ½ gallon/3 minutes. The timer was set to come on 6 hours/day split so that the RO comes on ~ 3X for 2 hours each time.\n\n\n\n\n11.6.2 Maintenance\n\nOnce a month or as needed\n\nChange and discard the pre-filter (city supply side)\nChange and discard the first carbon block filter (middle position)\nMove the second carbon filter (closest to the machine) to the middle position\nInstall new carbon block in and put a new carbon block in third position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhen the prefilter clogs the system will cycle on and off as the low pressure switch turns the unit off with low pressure but as soon as flow stops the pressure rebuilds and turns it back on. This will destroy your pump and or motor and is very bad for the contacts in the pressure switch.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.6.3 Notes on Parts\nI get the pump from Grainger ~$120\nProcon pump, membranes, prefilters and carbon blocks from Pacific RO. http://www.pacificro.com The guy’s name is Bob and his prices are significantly lower than anything else I’ve found. I just place a $2k order with him yesterday.\nApplied Membranes inc www.appliedmembranes.com is another source I’ve used.\nCraig from Oregon Water treatment just stopped buy and I’m buying new units from him. He’s matching Aquatic Eco’s low prices, he’s local and great to work with so I’m most likely going to be shifting all my business his way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe tw30-2526 membranes for the hp 900 water factory is now a higher producing membrane twhp30-2526. Makes more water.",

The filter will now take itself through the backwash cycle. This takes about 30–40 minutes. When the cycle is done, unplug the filter\nLabel front of filter with time of backwash and when next backwash is needed\n\n\n\n\n11.8.2 Filter Re-bed (activated carbon)\n\nMaterials\n\nWater hose to wash out used media\nMuck buckets\nFunnel\nGranular activated carbon (FilterWater.com, model #FM-GAC-01) 1 cu.\nSand (Quickcrete model # 115251, coarse and washed)\nDuct tape\n\n\n\nProcedure\nDisconnect Vessel\n\nTurn off water source\nOpen valve to relieve pressure\nDisconnect vessel\n\nRemove Carbon and Sand\n\nUnscrew head mechanism\nPosition vessel on side near water hose\nPosition muck bucket to catch media\nSpray water into vessel to remove carbon and sand\nCollect media and strain to remove water. Put used carbon into garbage sack and place in dumpster\n\nReplace carbon and sand\n\nDry top of riser and seal with duct tape\nUse funnel and add 4 inches of sand until top of riser is covered\nAdd carbon to 18” below top of riser giving room for backwash mode\n\nReconnect vessel\n\nRemover duct tape\nReconnect head control system (a little gasket grease may be needed to make a tight seal)\nReconnect vessel to plumbing\nFill with water and allow it to sit overnight so that the carbon absorbs water\nTurn water on and initiate backwash cycle",

    "text": "11.9 Programming Fish Room Lighting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCreated: 3-20-2008 by M Currey\n\n\n\n11.9.1 Materials\n\nPC\nLiason software and manual\n\n\n\n11.9.2 Programming Overview\nProgramming of fish room lighting regimes is done using the wall unit Grafik Eye 3000 and a PC. The unit is programmed in terms of scenes. Each scene specifies a lighting event, e.g. turning on the lights in one room over a 1/2 hour time period. Scenes are set at the control unit following the directions in the manual. Four scenes have been set up to turn off or on lighting in the main room and the breeding room.\n\n\n11.9.3 Procedure\nScene Configuration:\n\nScene 1: Main room ON with 30 min dawn\nScene 2: Main room OFF with 30 min dusk\nScene 3: Breeding room ON with 30 min dawn\nScene 4: Breeding room OFF with 30 min dusk\n\nOnce the scenes are programmed you must tell the unit when to activate the scenes. This is done with a PC and Grafik Eye Liason software. If the software needs to be installed do so. Connect the PC to the control unit.\nIn EDIT MODE:\n\nSelect control unit (I think that this unit is GRX3105)\nGo to schedule (Not program)\nDrag scenes (upper right box) to desired times\nDrag control unit (lower right box) to each scene\nBe sure and copy schedule to the weekend\nGo to FILE and establish communications via Online Options\nAfter communications have been established go back to edit mode\nGo to Online Options and select transfer data. This should program the wall unit when to activate scenes",

    "text": "15.3 Embryo Injections\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFrom: Zebrafish Book 4th addition chp 5 CHAPTER 5 - CELLULAR METHODS Source: E. Weinberg\n\n\nThis is an easy method for holding embryos while injecting DNA, lineage tracer dyes, etc., without removing their chorions. The embryos are held in wedged-shaped troughs made with a plastic mold in 1.5% agarose. Each trough can hold approximately 35 embryos (with chorions). Embryos can be aligned by gently tamping them down with forceps. Agarose is useful because pipette tips generally will not break if they accidently touch the surface. As the pipette penetrates the chorion, the embryo is forced against the rear vertical wall of the trough. The exact positioning of the pipette tip within the embryo is achieved by slight movement of the pipette with a micromanipulator or by movement of the stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf the pipette tip is thin and long enough, it can be withdrawn from the chorion without dragging the embryo out of the trough. A problem with thin pipettes, however, is that they lack the tensile strength to penetrate the chorion and bend when forced onto the chorion surface. Thicker pipettes do not easily slip out of the chorion, although the embryo can be held with forceps as the pipette is slowly withdrawn.\n\n\nAlternatively, a plastic cover can be used to impede the withdrawal of the embryo. The plastic cover fits snugly into the indentation in the agarose created by the plastic mold. The slits in the cover can be aligned with the somewhat narrower troughs in the agarose by sliding the cover from side to side. (The width of the cover is 2.0 mm less than that of the mold allowing one to achieve the desired position for injection.) The cover is 1.0 mm thick at the border, but only 0.7 mm thick between the openings so the embryos will slide off the pipette more readily.\n\n15.3.1 Making the chambers\n\nPour approximately 20 ml of hot 1.5% agarose in embryo medium into a 100 x 15 Petri dish on a level surface. Wait until completely solidified\nAdd an additional 20 ml of the 1.5% agarose to the dish. Set the plastic mold (teeth down) into the liquid agarose overlay, tapping to eliminate any bubbles\nAfter the agarose sets, add a small amount of medium, wrap the Petri dish in parafilm, and store in the refrigerator\n\n\n\n15.3.2 Injecting\n\nWarm the Petri dish to the temperature you prefer for injection (embryos can tolerate 18°C for about 1 hour, and the slower division rate allows more time to inject at the 1 and 2 cell stage)\nRemove the plastic mold\nPosition the dish on a microscope stage and adjust the angle of the pipette so that you can aim directly into the trough\nTransfer embryos into the troughs and set the plastic cover with slits into the depression in the agarose\nUsing forceps, align the embryos all in the same orientation. Add enough culture medium so that the level reaches the plastic edges of the slits. Gently tamp the embryos down into the trough\nUsing controls on the micromanipulator, force the pipette through the chorion and the yolk cell, entering the embryonic cell(s) from the yolk cell. (You might prefer to enter the embryonic cell directly; in this case, you would choose a different orientation of the embryo in the trough)\nAs the pipette goes through the yolk, move the Petri dish a bit so that the pipette is close to the plastic cover\nInject the desired volume of solution and then withdraw the pipette with a slow steady motion. The embryo will catch on the plastic cover and drop back into the trough\nTransfer the embryos into a dish with embryo medium and maintain at 28.5°C for further development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTop view and cross-section of the plastic slot maker (A) and plastic cover piece (B). All dimensions are in mm. An enlarged view of a cross-section of the teeth is shown in the lower part of panel (A). The area within the dotted lines, in the diagram of the cover piece in panel (B), is 0.7 mm thick whereas the border area outside the dotted lines is 1.0 mm thick.",

This protocol has been adapted for use in stickleback from an established, approved zebrafish protocol.\n\n\n16.3.2 Procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe bacterial inoculums should be determined empirically for each species used. For many bacteria 10⁴ Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per milliliter of stickleback medium will suffice for full colonization of the intestine and minimal toxicity to the fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDead larvae in the flask will be removed as this will often result in increased bacterial growth that can ultimately be fatal to the remaining larvae.\n\n\nThe method below is used for several proteobacteria strains:\n\nRaise fish in a germ-free environment as described in Section 16.1\nIncubate bacteria for 16 hours in 50ml of growth medium in 250 ml flask at 25°C, 200 RPM. These bacteria will originate from the intestine of a healthy stickleback to ensure that the bacteria are not pathogens\nMeasure the Optical Density₆₀₀ (OD₆₀₀) of the culture\nCalculate the original culture density, assuming 1 OD₆₀₀ = 10⁹ CFU / ml\nDilute the culture to pre-determined concentration as needed in filter sterilized stickleback medium, and inoculate flask in tissue culture hood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe fish will be exposed to the bacteria in the water after their digestive system is open and they have been shown to consume food, which occurs between 9 and 13 days post fertilization. The inoculums will be determined in a manner similar to those already established for zebrafish and used regularly in the Guillemin laboratory. Germ-free fish water is inoculated between 1000 and 1000000 bacteria per milliliter so the concentration the concentration can be chosen that results in healthy fish surviving to three days post-exposure.\n\n\n\nPlate dilutions of the original bacterial culture in order to verify the CFU/ml of the inoculum\nMonitor fish daily for signs of illness, including lack of motility, response to external stimuli, rapid movement of opercular (gill) cover and any other sign of non-normal behavior\nIf a dead fish is found, remove fish and place in morgue (see Sick and Dead fish SOP), record on daily checklist and alert supervisor\nAt the end of the experiment, euthanize fish by established and approved protocols (see approved stickleback euthanasia protocol)",

On the same and adjoining floors, and contiguous with our space, are nine other labs studying evolutionary genetics The Cresko research group occupies one main lab (1050 sq. ft.), a cell culture facility with sterile hood (225 sq. ft.), an adjacent stickleback aquatic facility (690sq. ft.), and a shared fluorescence microscopy room, all on the third floor of Pacific Hall.\n\n\n20.1.2 Colleagues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOne of the most important resources is colleagues.\n\n\nThe P.I.’s lab is adjacent to labs of six other evolutionary geneticists: N. Singh (evolutionary genomics in Drosophila), B. Bohannan (bacterial evolution), W. Bradshaw (genetic basis of evolutionary change in W. Smithii), M. Barber (protein evolution), K. McGuire (tropical ecology), P. Phillips (evolutionary genetics using Caenorhabditis), P. Ralph (population genomics), M.Streisfeld (evolutionary genetics of Mimulus), and also John Conery (computational biology of gene and genome evolution).\nIn addition, the Institutes of Molecular Biology (IMB) and Neuroscience (ION) contain numerous researchers with particular interest in the evolution and developmental mechanisms, including K. Guillemin (host-bacterial co-evolution), E. Johnson (genomics of stress response systems), C. Kimmel (developmental genetics), J. Postlethwait (genome evolution), J. Eisen (host-microbe developmental interactions), R. Parthasarathy (live imaging of host-microbe interactions), A. Powell (genomics and tissue modeling in gut development), and T. Ursell (cell mechanics, behavior, modeling).\nMonday morning research meetings, Monday IE2 seminars and META center meetings, Tuesday IMB and Thursday ION seminars, Wednesday IE2 tea time, Friday evo-devo biology and META center journal club meetings, and encounters in the hall all bring us and our students in frequent contact with one another.\n\n\n20.1.3 Offices\nDr. Cresko’s office (200 sq. ft.) is on the same hall as the lab and stickleback facility. Key personnel have dedicated desk space in the laboratory or adjoining offices.\n\n\n20.1.4 Computer\nThe Cresko Lab has several Macintosh, Windows and Linux computers, including a dedicated computer cluster (48 cores, 541GB of memory, 67TB local general purpose storage in a hardware RAID60 configuration, 64TB local backup storage in two hardware RAID6 configurations) for analyzing large data sets. All computers are networked to the university system via 100G connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Accessible Services\n\n\n\nThe Cresko Lab also hosts several community accessible services:\n\nOMERO image server (http://omero.uoregon.edu) serves as a repository of cross-referenced stickleback microsopy images for the Cresko Lab and collaborators\nMetagenomics online database (http://metagenomics.uoregon.edu/metagenomicsdb), which was developed in house to serve the Microbial Ecology and Theory of Animals (META) Center for Systems Biology (http://meta.uoregon.edu/)\nStickleback Database (http://sticklebackdb.uoregon.edu:8080/sticklebackdb/) was developed in house to track stickleback crosses and collections from the wild\nRNA-seqlopedia (http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu) was written by the Cresko Lab and provides an overview of RNA-seq and of the experimental design choices necessary to carry out a successful RNA-seq project\n\n\n\n\n\n20.1.5 Animal Facility\nThe Cresko Lab operates a newly renovated stickleback aquatic facility (690 sq. ft.) capable of housing up to 4000 adult fish and 144 individualized genetic crosses, and contains experiment space specially designed for microscopy and microinjection of embryos for CRISPR, and production of gnotobiotic stickleback (i.e., fish with experimenter-defined microbial communities, including fish with no microbes, or with one or more microbial strains).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe facility is managed by Mark Currey (senior research assistant), who designed and maintains the husbandry systems and databases, and directs a staff of animal care technicians.\n\n\nThe facility, located in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution adjacent to the Cresko Lab, is completely enclosed allowing for the care and maintenance of multiple lines of stickleback that have been derived from natural populations. Most of these lines have been in continuous culture since 2003 with current stocks representing over 12 generations in the facility.\nTwo of the rooms are used to house animals and each room is outfitted with a dedicated recirculating aquaculture system. Lighting in these rooms is manipulated so that one room is set up for a summer lighting regime and the other a winter lighting regime. These lighting regimes allow for the conditioning of the fish to breed (summer regime) and for growing the fish from fry to adults (winter regime). These facilities allow for the ability to perform specific crosses in a controlled environment at precise times so that development can be standardized and quantified.\nThe third room is used for experiments, and to store and prepare food and husbandry supplies. Half of this room is dedicated for experimental manipulations such as the microinjection procedures of CRISPR or for generating gnotobiotic fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis is one of several model fish facilities at the University of Oregon, and helps maintain compliance for the university’s AAALAC accreditation. UO, known as the birthplace of zebrafish research, has a full-time staffed zebrafish facility (see Aquatic Animal Care Services). Expertise in fish husbandry gathered by developing the zebrafish system at Oregon augments and supports the successful husbandry of stickleback.\n\n\n\n\n20.1.6 Equipment\nMicroscopes (fluorescent, compound, dissecting, confocal), centrifuges, sonication and bead beating apparatus, cold rooms, freezers, thermocyclers, spectrophotometers and fluorometers, -80C and liquid nitrogen freezers, and other equipment are either in our lab or available nearby as shared equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Cresko Lab has an Arcturus Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) microscope that has both an Infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) laser that can be used to ablate or to capture microdissected tissues or small numbers of cells, from fixed sections for downstream DNA and RNA analyses.\n\n\nThe Cresko Lab’s stickleback facility houses equipment for performing transgenic and gene knockout experiments: a microinjection needle puller and two microinjection systems, including dissection microscopes, micromanipulators, and electronic pressure injection controller.\nThe following equipment is available in the Cresko lab:\n\nMultiple microcentrifuges and swinging bucket centrifuges\nSonication and bead beating apparatus\nCold rooms, refrigerators, and freezers (-20, -80C, and liquid nitrogen)\nThermocyclers and gel electrophoresis equipment\nSpectrophotometers and fluorometers\nA shared microscopy facility with several compound and dissecting microscopes\nTissue culture facility equipped with laminar flow hood, incubators, culture media, and sterilizing facility\nSeveral Macintosh, Windows and Linux computers, including a cluster (48 cores, 541GB of memory, 67TB local general purpose storage in a hardware RAID60 configuration, 64TB local backup storage in two hardware RAID6 configurations)",

Data backups are performed each evening. For usage and processing of data, PSI maintains several available workstations with ample software, from word processing to statistical programs. The PSI servers are port-restricted from the rest of the UO network using high-end network firewall appliances and are accessible only through secure means. All data files are protected by a strict access control rules, and access is provided to only a small group of trusted users who require it, thus reducing the exposure of sensitive data. If further data-security is needed, PSI has a special securely-encrypted storage area that has further restrictions in place to prevent any unauthorized data transmissions.\nZoom: UO faculty members, staff, and students have access to Zoom videoconferencing services. For UO Zoom users who handle HIPAA-regulated data, a HIPAA-compliant environment is available that includes Zoom, which establishes strict access control rules and strong AES256 encryption to prevent transmission of any PHI (protected health information).\nVPN: PSI and Cresko lab faculty and staff have access to a VPN connection, when off campus, to servers. The VPN utilizes Cisco AnyConnect platform and is secured with end-to-end strong AES256, and then TLS1.2 for any key exchange or authentication. VPN Users are placed into a specific network pool that is then further port restricted from any critical systems. This gives VPN users the benefit of still being able to access their data, where allowed, but prevents VPN users from accessing any critical administration items or underlying infrastructure.\nWorkstations: PSI has made available workstation and laptops available to its faculty and staff, so as to allow them to continue their work confidently and securely. All PSI-owned workstations are security controlled through a strong set of policies and authentication mechanisms that maintain security for the workstation when interfacing with PSI servers. Drive and transport encryption is employed on the workstations.",

The RCFs are run in a research compliant fashion using subsidy from the OVPRI for the Director’s salary and the proportional salaries of members of Research Core Business Services who are well trained in finance and compliance. Below is a list of the salient RCFs for this project.\n\n20.7.1 Genomics and Cell Characterization Core Facility\nThis facility is directed by Dr. Doug Turnbull and staffed by top genomics personnel, including several full time laboratory technicians and the General and Technical Supervisor for the CLIA laboratory. In anticipation of the growing need to support SARS-CoV-2 testing, the facility is beginning searches for three additional laboratory technicians.\nThe main laboratory houses Illumina NovaSeq, NextSeq500 and MiSeq massively parallel sequencers and two systems for use in long molecule sequencing: 10x Genomics’s platform for producing short-read Illumina-compatible DNA- or RNA-seq libraries starting from nucleic acids or from single cells and a PacBio Sequel II. These platforms are run by Dr. Turnbull and his staff, who also provide sequencing library preparation services, particularly for the PacBio and 10x Genomics platforms. Output data are initially processed by computer scientist Nicholas Stiffler. The facility charges for reagents, personnel time, and service contract. The facility’s sequencing, fragment analysis and library preparation services will continue to be a critical part of our research program. This facility also oversees a dedicated biological imaging space that contains specialty microscopes including light sheet, confocals, and the expertise needed to effectively use them. The CLIA testing laboratory described is administratively part of GC3F.\nEquipment:\n\nIllumina HiSeq4000, NextSeq500 and MiSeq massively parallel sequencers\nPacBio Sequel2\n10x Genomics’ platforms\nTwo flow cytometers (Sony SH800 Cell Sorter and Applied Biosystems Attune Cytometer)\nEppendorf EPMotion 5075 TMX liquid handling robot\n128 thread primary analysis server for processing next generation sequencing data\nSuite of advanced light microscopes including a Zeiss Elyra and Nikon Sora for super-resolution imaging\nSequencing, fragment analysis, and library preparation services and equipment\n\n\n\n20.7.2 Research Advanced Computing Services (RACS) and Talapas high performance cluster\nTalapas is the University of Oregon’s primary supercomputer. It was built in 2017 and is managed by Director Dr. Nick Maggio and his staff. The Cresko laboratory has an unlimited membership to the cluster via a yearly membership. Talapas is a heterogeneous supercomputing cluster capable of performing over 1.2 quadrillion calculations per second and providing 1.5 petabytes (1,500 trillion bytes) of high performance, parallel data storage.\nTalapas makes three distinct classes of compute nodes available to researchers: standard compute nodes built around the Intel “Broadwell” and “Skylake” generations of processor, GPU compute nodes equipped with dual nVidia Tesla K80 accelerators, and large memory servers. This large compute cluster has over 200 standard nodes with at least 128GB of memory each, 24 GPU nodes with 256GB memory each, and 8 large memory nodes with 1TB to 4TB of memory each. Talapas computational and storage resources are networked together via EDR Infiniband and connected to Internet2 via a high-speed 100 GigE interconnect. Talapas is open to all UO researchers and students for scientific research.\nSpecifications:\n\nHeterogeneous supercomputing cluster capable of performing over 250 trillion calculations ever second and providing 1.5 petabytes (1,500 trillion bytes) of high performance, parallel data storage\nStandard compute nodes built around the Intel “Broadwell” generation of processor, GPU compute nodes equipped with dual nVidia Tesla K80 accelerators, and large memory servers\n96 standard nodes with 128GB of memory each, 24 GPU nodes with 256GB memory each, and 8 large memory nodes with 4TB of memory each\nThe cluster presently has 1.5 Petabytes of storage (soon to be 10 Petabytes)\n\n\n\n20.7.3 Aquatic Animal Care Services\nThis service, directed by Timothy Mason, provides cutting edge animal husbandry and experimental expertise for working with aquatic animals. The facility maintains housing and veterinary care for zebrafish stocks with a capacity of more than a million fish, husbandry training, and cryopreservation of sperm, and provides experiment rooms for microinjection and other research activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUO is the birthplace of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model vertebrate, having been pioneered by Dr. George Streisinger in the 1970s. The amassed expertise in zebrafish at this facility and in the many UO research labs it serves has greatly facilitated the development of other emerging aquatic models at the UO, including threespine stickleback and spotted gar.\n\n\n\n\n20.7.4 Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC)\nZIRC, co-directed by Zoltan Varga and Monte Westerfield, is across the street from our lab, and it provides the world’s central repository for wild-type and mutant strains of zebrafish and for materials and information about zebrafish research. They distribute materials and zebrafish strains to the international research community. ZIRC provides pathology services for potentially diseased fish, including those from the Cresko Lab stickleback facility.\n\n\n20.7.5 Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN)\nZFIN (http://zfin.org) is an online digital resource that contains and distributes information about zebrafish research to the world. These resources include information about zebrafish genetics, genomics, and development, among many other things. ZFIN also provides a clearing house for information on researchers to encourage collaboration networks. Having this vast repository of information and tools for fish developmental genetics easily accessible greatly enhances our ability to perform evolutionary developmental analysis.\n\n\n20.7.6 Biological Imaging Core\nThis facility brings together specialty microscopes including light sheet, laser capture microdissection, confocals, and the expertise needed to effectively use them. These resources will be critical in the three-dimensional visualization and documentation of transgene expression in living sticklebacks, as well as observation of living microbial endosymbionts in the stickleback gut. The light sheet microscope has already proven itself for studying interactions of microbes in the gut of living zebrafish larvae here at UO, and we will be able to adapt these methodologies to using stickleback larvae.\n\n\n20.7.7 Histology and Genetic Modification Core Facility\nThis facility, directed by Dr. Ute Hostick, offers cryo-, paraffin and plastic sectioning, and histological staining. These services will be useful for phenotyping of mutant stickleback strains, when characterization by in situ hybridization on cryosectioned tissue or histological staining of fixed, sectioned tissue is required. This cutting edge facility also provides many procedures for generating and strain storage of genetically modified mice, including pronuclear injection, embryo cryopreservation stem cell tissue culture and genotyping.\n\n\n20.7.8 Center for Advanced Materials Characterization in Oregon (CAMCOr)\nThis facility, directed by Kurt Langworthy, houses multiple TEM and SEM microscopes, and many apparatus for NMR, X-ray crystallography, and other specialized microscopy for life sciences, materials science and chemistry applications. In addition, the facility houses resource for nanofabrication and microfluidics. In addition, a new Zeiss Versa X-ray microscope housed in this facility produces exquisite 3-D high resolution scans of biological and non-biological subjects non-destructively.\n\n\n20.7.9 Technical Science Administration\nThis facility, directed by John Boosinger, houses professional machinists and electrical engineers who help design and build research instrumentation. For the Cresko research group, this has included such diverse things as fish husbandry and microinjection equipment.\n\n\n20.7.10 Lewis Center for Neuroimaging\nThis facility, directed by Fred Sabb, supports research in cognitive science and biological imaging and includes a Siemens Skyra functional MRI and staff who design and fabricate MR coils suited to a variety of projects.\n\n\n20.7.11 Molecular Biology Kitchen\nThis facility provides us with media, plates, sterilized pipette tips, buffers, and clean glassware for molecular biology and bacteriology needs.\n\n\n20.7.12 Lab Supply Stores\nLaboratory supplies and small equipment are available for purchase in a centralized store maintained by Thermofisher in a science building adjacent to ours.",

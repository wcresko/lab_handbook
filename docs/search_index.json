[["index.html", "A Minimal Book Example Chapter 1 Prerequisites", " A Minimal Book Example Yihui Xie 2021-04-22 Chapter 1 Prerequisites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For storage: Aliquot into 6 x 25 ml fish safe plastic bottles and store at 4C.

Add 25 drops 1N HCl. pH should be 7.0-7.2. Filter and store at 4C not more than 1 week.

Without agitation and with lid open until eyes start to lighten and all skin pigment is gone (usually about an hour or more) 2 2 h to O/N at R/T on shaker 2 h to overnight O/N at R/T on shaker. Check for bone staining. R/T on shaker until excess stain in tissue is gone. Without agitation Wild caught specimens are put in 100% EtOH in the field and then rehydrated and put into 4% when back in the lab. "],["references.html", "References", " References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

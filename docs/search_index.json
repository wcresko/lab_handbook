Our laboratory studies the developmental genetic and genomic basis of evolution in natural populations. We use the threespine stickleback and zebrafish as the main animal models in the laboratory, as well as syngnathid. We have produced some of the first work that has helped develop stickleback into a model for dissecting the genetic basis of natural variation. We have developed genomic tools such as sequenced Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) tags that help geneticists apply Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies to biomedical and evolutionary genetic problems. These techniques allow for the efficient identification of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genomes of models and non-model organisms. We produced the first SNP whole genome-scan for selection in the stickleback genome, and we developed novel Maximum Likelihood (ML) analytical tools for NGS data. Computational biologists and computer scientists in our team have produced software packages for genomic analyses that are used by laboratories around the world for the analysis of big data problems. Our laboratory has developed protocols, best practices, and tools for RNA-seq based transcriptomic functional analyses.

To advance personnel safety while also recognizing research needs, the LSAC developed this guidance document to assist lab workers in recognizing dangers and developing appropriate procedures. The primary danger in working alone is that if an accident should occur, there will be delays in rendering aid. 5.1.1 Before working alone, you should: Ensure that you have been trained on the procedures, reviewed the safety data sheets for all associate materials, and know the emergency procedures for your lab. Consider whether the risk outweighs the benefits of working alone. Consider whether this work can be done at a time when others are around. Consider using a buddy system with individuals in other labs nearby. If you decide to proceed with hazardous procedures on your own, please use a check-in or text-in system with supervisors or peers, ensuring that they know where and when this work is done and that they have contact information readily available for campus safety personnel. 5.1.2 Specific Guidelines for the Cresko Lab Examples of materials and procedures in THIS laboratory that should be avoided while working alone are provided below. Should you choose to do lone work of this nature, ensure that others know where and when this work will be performed, and when it is completed.

Currey) ### Materials Needed: • 25, 45 and 90mm disposable sterile petri dishes (standard) • Sterile Ginzburg’s Fish Ringers solution containing antibiotic and antimycotics for testes (see Testes Solution recipe) • MS222 Tricaine Methanesulfonate (see Mesab recipe) • 100% ethanol • Fine scissors and forceps • Wide-blade entomology forceps • Sterile Embryo medium (6ml of Instant Ocean into 1L npH2O) • Squeeze wash bottles • Stress coat (standard from pet store) • Sterile flat razor blades • Sterile disposable large bore transfer pipettes (VWR cat# 691) • Dissecting microscope Squeeze Female: Cover fingers with stress coat and gently squeeze gravid female. Gravid females have extended abdomens and their eggs have “dropped.” If eggs do not emerge with very slight pressure the female is not quite ready. Squeeze eggs with motion from pectoral girdle posterior to the cloaca into a 25mm sterile petri dish. The small size of petri dish allows the sperm to be concentrated on the eggs. Dissect Testes From Male: Euthanize male by placing him into a finger bowl of embryo medium containing a lethal volume of MS222. Clean a large, 30cm by 60cm or similar size, glass sheet, fine scissors, and forceps with 100% ethanol. When male is motionless, remove and rinse fish with clean water and sever spinal cord behind skull using a razor to be sure of euthanization. Use scissors to make incision just posterior to the cloaca and cut from there anteriorly to the pelvic girdle making an incision along the mid line of the fish. Make another cut to each side of the fish from the cloaca dorsally approximately 15mm so that the body cavity is easily accessed. Incisions should be made just deep enough to cut the skin and body wall muscle while being wary to not cut into the stomach and intestines that are located just below the skin surface. Locate paired testes and vas deferens (testes are variable in shape and coloration, but are usually long and pigmented, usually having the same pigmentation as the skin surface, and sit in the dorsal part of the coelom near the kidneys. The vas deferens are threadlike and are usually as long as the testis to which it connects. Use fine forceps to grab vas deferens, sever near the cloaca, and remove one (or often) both testes. Doing so keeps the testes intact, allowing them to contain viable sperm for up to 1 month at 4°C in Testes Solution. Storing of Testes: If only a single cross is to be made with a male, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, place testes into 45mm petri dish filled with cold Testes Solution. Store testes at 4°C. To store testes for extended periods, change out medium once a week. Prepare Testis: If multiple crosses are to be performed from a single pair of male’s testes, remove one testis and place on the inside lid of the 25mm petri dish into which a females eggs have been squeezed. Using a sterile razor, slice off a small piece of testis (we’ve found a large testis can be used to fertilize approximately 5 clutches). Make cuts as perpendicular as possible to the major axis of the testis and perform multiple cuts from the same end. This allows as much of the sperm to remain packaged and inactivated at the center of the testis. Use blade to macerate testis. Under a dissecting scope swimming sperm should cause a ‘sparkling’ refraction. Add approximately 1.0 ml of sterile embryo medium to testis prep with disposable pipette, mix, and then add to the eggs one drop at a time, using same disposable pipette, dispersing drops between petri dishes so that all eggs are covered with sperm mixture. Fertilization (time = 0): Fertilization of most eggs will occur almost instantaneously. However, I leave the sperm on the eggs for about 5-10 minutes. At this point cover embryos with embryo medium. Mark fertilization time (this is the time that the initial drops of sperm were added) on the surface of the petri dish. Place in incubator at 20°C. Separation of Embryos and Second Cleaning (t = 2 hr): The animal pole of the embryo is established at the site of sperm entry, and at 20°C the first cell syncitium is usually visible within 45 minutes. The first cell division usually occurs approximately 25 minutes later, and the two cell stage is fully visible approximately 1.5hr after fertilization. During this time, the chorion thickens and attaches to the petri dish as well as to other embryos. At or after 2 hours post fertilization, use the wide blade entomological forceps to detach the embryos from one another, as well as to dislodge embryos from the bottom of the petri dish. Remove all of the unfertilized eggs to limit mold contamination, and record the total number of eggs and embryos. Rinse embryos 3 to 4 more times then distribute embryos to 90mm petri dishes (30-50 embryos per dish) filled half way with fresh embryo medium. Enter cross information into database, print labels for dishes, and place embryos into incubator at 20°C. Raise Embryos (check daily): Embryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time [see http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html], and hatch at approximately 7 days. 48hr stickleback embryos have completed most major morphogenetic processes, and the melanic pigment cells are just starting to migrate.

Hatching, Begin Feeding Brine Shrimp, and Move to System (t = 7-8 days post fertilization): After hatching at 7-8 days post fertilization, remove chorions and allow young to absorb yolk (2-3 days). At approximately day 2 post hatching take petri dish containing fry out of incubator and place dishes on a table. To each petri dish add approximately the same volume of system water, as there is embryo medium; this will double the volume of liquid in the dish. This acclimates the fry to the system water. Allow the fry to acclimate for 6-10 hours, the longer the better. Then transfer fry to small aquaria on the system.

Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step. If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min. Filter and rinse cysts: Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 um mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water. Transfer cysts back to the cone: Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone. De-capsulation: Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange, When the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 um mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water. Neutralization residual chlorine: To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear. Dehydration for long-term storage: Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200 - 300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine. Store in refrigerator. The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month.

Siphon (cleaning by “vacuuming”) Attach siphon tip onto siphon hose. The siphon tips, which are attached to the hoses, are the only parts of this apparatus that can be immersed in the tank. Start siphon by running system water into hose until hose is filled with water. Turn valve so that water is “trapped” in hose. Put end of tip into tank that is being cleaned and turn valve back on creating a siphon. Vacuum all waste off of the bottom being careful to not suck up any fish. Use each tip in only one tank and then sterilize it by washing in the dishwasher (see Dishwasher SOP). Scrubbing (removal of algae from sides, front, and back of tank) is done on an “as needed” basis. (If you can’t see into the tank, it’s past time to scrub.)

Please use splash proof glasses or a face shield when using bleach and sodium thiosulfate. Complete bleaching and cleaning of tank. This needs to be done to each tank every 2 months. Remove fish from tank and put them into a clean tank. Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced. Drain the tank and remove it from the rack. Clean all parts with brushes and a scrub pad or put into the bleach bin. Clean the tank thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside (algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it. Squirt about 10 – 20 mls of bleach into the tank. Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand, using a pad, sponge, tank back, or other means to expose all inside portions of the tank to bleach. Rinse the tank thoroughly with hot tap water. Rinse the tank with sodium thiosulfate, and then rinse it again with hot water. Put a few thiosulfate crystals into the tank and leave it.

If some are still wet, set them out to dry on the drying rack before putting them away. RINSE ALL DIRTY DISHES VERY WELL, especially those with algae/food residue. the dishwasher will sanitize, but will not effectively clean, the dishes. Scrub dishes with a scrub pad to remove buildup, if needed. Tank tube and bulkhead pieces should be hung on the vertical rinsing pipes on the bottom rack; longer tank tubes should be placed on the top rack if they would impede the rinser on the bottom of the top rack from spinning. Small tank lids should be stacked on the bottom rack, but not on the raised portion of the rack, as this impedes the rinser from spinning properly. Plastic tanks, Ziploc containers and long tank tubes should be placed on the top rack. BEFORE RUNNING THE DISHWASHER, SLIDE BOTH RACKS IN AND MAKE SURE THE RINSER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP RACK CAN SPIN FREELY 10.4.2 Running the dishwasher: Add ~1/2 scoop of dish detergent (found under the sink) to the well in the door of the dishwasher. Close the lid to the well. Close and latch the door to the dishwasher. The display will light up, and after booting up it should read “User 1.” Press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle. If it instead displays a list of programs, use the down arrow key to navigate down the list to “User 1.” When the “User 1” program is highlighted, press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle. If the screen displays something other than “User 1,” press the DISPLAY button to show the list of programs, scroll down to “User 1,” and press RUN/CANCEL. Should the program ever need to be cancelled mid-cycle, pressing the RUN/CANCEL button once will result in the cycle canceling and the water draining. 10.4.3 Large tank lids: • The small frontal lids to the large glass tanks should be loaded into the dishwasher.

SOP - RO Maintenance (created December 14, 2011 m currey) For start up and more detailed info please refer to the manual. Determination of run time/day: • Run RO unit into container with known units of volume and determine the amount of time to fill desired volume. Determine the gallon per minute flow rate. If using a liter vessel; 3.8 liters = 1 gallon. • The system is ~ 2000 gallons. Ideally we will want to change 5-10% of the water each day. This is 100-200 gallons. • Set timer that RO unit is plugged into so that it is on the desired amount of time using the gallons/minute rate determined in step 1. ** On 111214 the RO flow rate is ½ gallon/3 minutes. The timer was set to come on 6 hours/day split so that the RO comes on ~ 3X for 2 hours each time. Maintenance: Once a month or as needed: 1. Change and discard the pre-filter (city supply side) 2. Change and discard the first carbon block filter (middle position) 3. Move the second carbon filter (closest to the machine) to the middle position 4. Install new carbon block in and put a new carbon block in third position When the prefilter clogs the system will cycle on and off as the low pressure switch turns the unit off with low pressure but as soon as flow stops the pressure rebuilds and turns it back on. This will destroy your pump and or motor and is very bad for the contacts in the pressure switch. Notes on Parts: I get the pump from Grainger ~$120 Procon pump, membranes, prefilters and carbon blocks from Pacific RO. http://www.pacificro.com The guy’s name is Bob and his prices are significantly lower than anything else I’ve found. I just place a $2k order with him yesterday. Applied Membranes inc www.appliedmembranes.com is another source I’ve used. Craig from Oregon Water treatment just stopped buy and I’m buying new units from him. He’s matching Aquatic Eco’s low prices, he’s local and great to work with so I’m most likely going to be shifting all my business his way. The tw30-2526 membranes for the hp 900 water factory is now a higher producing membrane twhp30-2526. Makes more water. Here are a few more bits and pieces for the units: Water supply solenoid valve (tough to get, Oregon water treatment or Paramount supply): If the water won’t shut off, the orifice has gone bad. Here’s the one I’m working on right now. 11 years of soft water has eaten the brass away preventing the solenoid from shutting flow off.

Reconnect head control system (a little gasket grease may be needed to make a tight seal). 3. Reconnect vessel to plumbing 4. Fill with water and allow it to sit overnight so that the carbon absorbs water. 5. Turn water on and initiate backwash cycle. SOP - Programming Fish Room Lighting (created 3-20-2008 by M Currey) Materials: PC Liason software and manual Programming of fish room lighting regimes is done using the wall unit Grafik Eye 3000 and a PC. The unit is programmed in terms of scenes. Each scene specifies a lighting event, e.g. turning on the lights in one room over a 1/2 hour time period. Scenes are set at the control unit following the directions in the manual. Four scenes have been set up to turn off or on lighting in the main room and the breeding room. Procedure: Scene 1: Main room ON with 30 min dawn. Scene 2: Main room OFF with 30 min dusk. Scene 3: Breeding room ON with 30 min dawn Scene 4: Breeding room OFF with 30 min dusk Once the scenes are programmed you must tell the unit when to activate the scenes. This is done with a PC and Grafik Eye Liason software. If the software needs to be installed do so. Connect the PC to the control unit.

Consequently, only reduced staff who is essential for fish care will be present in the facility. This document details the minimal procedures required for maintaining fish alive and healthy. 13.1.3 Personnel Qualifications/Responsibilities: This SOP is intended for directors, managers, and animal technicians working in fish facilities. Persons executing procedures herein must have previous training in basic fish husbandry including feeding, tank maintenance, dead/moribund fish removal, and must have previous training in basic water system maintenance. In addition, the various fish facilities and rooms will cross-train essential caretakers to ensure further back up of staff in the other facilities. 13.1.4 Equipment and Supplies: Food, feeding utensils, tank replacement parts, clean nets, water system tools, e.g., pH meter, water system supplies, e.g., Aragonite. 13.1.5 Procedure: Initiation of Emergency Care Program • As soon as the emergency situation is announced by University officials, facility directors, managers, or responsible personnel take the following steps: • Alert and call in a meeting with the essential staff that same day • Distribute this SOP to essential staff for animal care • Ensure that no new experiments involving live fish are started from then on • Ensure that fish in static tanks (e.g. fin clipped or awaiting identification) are placed back on the water system and have regular life support (running water, air etc) • Ensure that non-essential staff is sent home until further notice • An emergency check-list is provided in a central location that details job distribution and tracks execution of the minimal procedures in this SOP Feeding • Fish of all ages, i.e., adult and larvae, are fed only once per day. • Fish should receive only dry or flake-type food. • No live food culture is needed, however, already existing stocks of live food can be used up (e.g. paramecia cultures). Tank Maintenance • Water and air supply to tanks must be maintained. Check daily. • Tank change schedules and scrub/siphon schedules are suspended or reduced to the absolute minimum: only tanks with algae growth at the front screen need to be cleaned to allow continuing system and fish checks. Dead/Moribund Fish • Remove dead and/or moribund fish as they are discovered. Continue standard care procedures and use a clean net for each tank. Nets can be autoclaved, if trained personnel are available or, in dire cases, a dip in bleach can be used to sanitize nets. Central Water System Maintenance • Maintain checks of central water system chemistry and volume. • Confirm monitoring equipment is properly calibrated. • Confirm electronic monitoring, e.g., SCADA, systems are functioning and dial-out (calling) is enabled. Equipment Washing • Wash tanks and tank parts only as needed. IMPORTANT: Essential functions of husbandry do not include experimental procedures such as fin-clipping fish, genotyping, or crossing fish. Any fish discovered in static water containers of any kind at the start of the crisis period will be returned to their permanent housing locations. No resources will be devoted to supplying experimental equipment during a crisis period. Termination of Emergency Care Program As soon as the emergency has ended University officials will notify facility directors, managers, or responsible personnel to call everybody back to work, terminate the emergency program and reinstate standard operating procedures. 13.1.6 Essential Staff at Huestis: Tim Mason Manager Huestis basement tmason@uoregon.edu 541-346-4598 - 541-510-2091 Yes Javier Camoriano Research Assistant Huestis basement jcamoria@uoregon.edu 541-346-4512 x25 - Andy Kimm Lab Animal Tech II Huestis basement andykimm@uoneuro.uoregon.edu 541-346-4512 x12 541-942-3720 - - Marcie McFadden Research Assistant Huestis basement marcie@uoneuro.uoregon.edu 541-346-4512 x24 - 541-521-2408 Yes Rebecca Montgomery Research Associate Huestis basement andrews@uoneuro.uoregon.edu 541-346-4512 x13 541-342-6604 - - Thom Montgomery Research Assistant Huestis basement montgom@uoneuro.uoregon.edu 541-346-4512 x13 541-342-6604 - - 13.1.7 Essential Staff at ZIRC: Zoltan Varga Dir/Research Assoc 1307 Franklin zoltan@zebrafish.org 541-346-6099 541-689-2347 541-915-7336 Yes Monte Westerfield Dir/PI 337 Huestis monte@uoregon.edu 541-346-4607 541-343-5637 541-914-3813 Yes Katrina Murray Veterinarian 1307 Franklin katy@zebrafish.org 541-346-6028 541-343-2517 541-579-1419 Yes April Freeman Manager 1307 Franklin april@zebrafish.org 541-346-6028 541-461-7922 541-514-8310 Yes David Lains Aquaculturist 1307 Franklin david@zebrafish.org 541-346-6028 541-344-7623 541-228-4578 Yes Ron Holland IT Admin 1307 Franklin ron@zebrafish.org 541-346-6028 541-683-6926 No Anwar Adi IT Tech 1307 Franklin anwar@zebrafish.org 541-346-6028 541-513-7857 Yes Justin Bauer Animal Tech 1307 Franklin justin@zebrafish.org 541-346-6028 541-255-5259 Yes Calvin Smith Animal Tech 1307 Franklin calvin@zebrafish.org 541-346-6028 541-953-8786 Yes 13.1.8 Essential Staff at Pacific Stickleback Facility Mark Currey Manager Pacific 324 mcurrey@uoregon.edu 541-346-5189 541-685-1237 541-505-0006 Yes Bill Cresko PI Pacific 312 wcresko@uoregon.edu 541-346-4779 - 541-285-5446 yes Susie Bassham Senior Research Associate.

Place traps in areas with cover. Tether trap to shore or other non-movable object. Leave traps up to but not over 24 hours. Traps may need to be checked more frequently depending on the tidal influence of water body being investigated. Pull traps looking for endangered species such as salmonids, Oregon chub, and/or Bull Trout. If an endangered species is noticed open trap under water and release all of the fish. If no endangered species are noticed, remove trap from the water and empty contents in a bucket filled 1/3 with water from where the trapping is taking place.

Weinberg) This is an easy method for holding embryos while injecting DNA, lineage tracer dyes, etc., without removing their chorions. The embryos are held in wedged-shaped troughs made with a plastic mold in 1.5% agarose. Each trough can hold approximately 35 embryos (with chorions). Embryos can be aligned by gently tamping them down with forceps. Agarose is useful because pipette tips generally will not break if they accidently touch the surface. As the pipette penetrates the chorion, the embryo is forced against the rear vertical wall of the trough. The exact positioning of the pipette tip within the embryo is achieved by slight movement of the pipette with a micromanipulator or by movement of the stage. If the pipette tip is thin and long enough, it can be withdrawn from the chorion without dragging the embryo out of the trough. A problem with thin pipettes, however, is that they lack the tensile strength to penetrate the chorion and bend when forced onto the chorion surface. Thicker pipettes do not easily slip out of the chorion, although the embryo can be held with forceps as the pipette is slowly withdrawn. Alternatively, a plastic cover can be used to impede the withdrawal of the embryo. The plastic cover fits snugly into the indentation in the agarose created by the plastic mold. The slits in the cover can be aligned with the somewhat narrower troughs in the agarose by sliding the cover from side to side. (The width of the cover is 2.0 mm less than that of the mold allowing one to achieve the desired position for injection.) The cover is 1.0 mm thick at the border, but only 0.7 mm thick between the openings so the embryos will slide off the pipette more readily. 16.3.1 Making the chambers: Pour approximately 20 ml of hot 1.5% agarose in embryo medium into a 100 x 15 Petri dish on a level surface. Wait until completely solidified. Add an additional 20 ml of the 1.5% agarose to the dish. Set the plastic mold (teeth down) into the liquid agarose overlay, tapping to eliminate any bubbles. After the agarose sets, add a small amount of medium, wrap the Petri dish in parafilm, and store in the refrigerator. 16.3.2 Injecting: Warm the Petri dish to the temperature you prefer for injection (embryos can tolerate 18°C for about 1 hour, and the slower division rate allows more time to inject at the 1 and 2 cell stage). Remove the plastic mold. Position the dish on a microscope stage and adjust the angle of the pipette so that you can aim directly into the trough. Transfer embryos into the troughs and set the plastic cover with slits into the depression in the agarose. Using forceps, align the embryos all in the same orientation. Add enough culture medium so that the level reaches the plastic edges of the slits. Gently tamp the embryos down into the trough. Using controls on the micromanipulator, force the pipette through the chorion and the yolk cell, entering the embryonic cell(s) from the yolk cell. (You might prefer to enter the embryonic cell directly; in this case, you would choose a different orientation of the embryo in the trough.) As the pipette goes through the yolk, move the Petri dish a bit so that the pipette is close to the plastic cover. Inject the desired volume of solution and then withdraw the pipette with a slow steady motion. The embryo will catch on the plastic cover and drop back into the trough. Transfer the embryos into a dish with embryo medium and maintain at 28.5°C for further development. Top view and cross-section of the plastic slot maker (A) and plastic cover piece (B).

Place petri dish with fertilized eggs and embryo medium (6ppt Instant Ocean) in common 20C incubatorfor 4 hours. After 4 hours, remove any embryos that are arrested or deformed. Using a transfer pipette, transfer the healthy embryos to a petri dish containing the experimental treatment, freshwater, brackish water, or ocean water. Return the embryos to the 20C incubator On a daily basis, check on development of embryos. Change water every day, making sure to replace with correct salinity treatment. Remove the dead or deformed. At 8 dpf, after the embryos have hatched, move them to a 1 gallon glass jar full of the appropriate salinity water. On 9dpf, feed each jar enough artemia so that it is consumed by the juveniles within 15-30 minutes. Feed and change water every other day. Do not overcrowd as outlined in stickleback SOP. Check on fish at least twice EVERY DAY, and use the care checklist to denote daily health check, feeding, and water change. Look for sick or stressed fish (low rate of opercular fluttering, bad color, floating upside down, etc.) Check water quality on two random tanks in each treatment once every two days before water has been changed. If ammonia and/or nitrite are detected then change water more frequently, check water quality daily, and denote this on checklist. Ideal ammonia and nitrite levels are 0 ppm.At designated time of interest up to 40 days post-fertilization, remove fish with a small clean net Place fish in beaker containing MS-222 euthanasia dose (300 mg/L). Wait for fish’s operculum to stop moving, wait 10 minutes and fix. Fix appropriately in liquid nitrogen, 4%PFA, or Bouin’s.

Glass 1 gallon fish containers (not plastic due to endocrine disruptive properties) with loose fitting lids Stickleback fish feeding SOP supplies (artemia, dry flakes, etc.) Stickleback fish crossing and rearing SOP supplies. 16.7.2 Procedure: Follow stickleback crossing and rearing SOP to generate 100-200 fertilized embryos of both Boot Lake and Rabbit Slough populations. Place petri with fertilized eggs in embryo medium (6ppt Instant Ocean) and place in common 20C incubator in Pacific 324 for 4 hours. After 4 hours, pipette off any embryos that are arrested or are deformed. Using a transfer pipette, transfer the healthy embryos to a petri dish containing the experimental treatment or the control. Properly dispose of all perchlorate treated water into carboy marked “perchlorate water.” Wear gloves and closed toe shoes. Return to 20C incubator marked “perchlorate experiment” for the perchlorate treated embryos. Return controls to common use incubator. On a daily basis, check on development of embryos. Change waterevery day, making sure to replace with correct perchlorate treatment. Remove the dead or deformed embryos. At 8 dpf, after the embryos have hatched, move them to a 1 gallon glass jar full of the appropriate salinity water. On 9dpf, feed the juveniles in each jar enough artemia so that it is consumed within 15-30 minutes. Feed and change water every other day. Do not overcrowd as outlined in stickleback SOP. Check on fish at least twice EVERY DAY, and use the care checklist to denote daily health check, feeding, and water change. Look for sick or stressed fish (low rate of opercular fluttering, bad color, floating upside down, etc.) Check water quality on two random tanks in each treatment once every two days before water has been changed. If ammonia and/or nitrite are detected then change water more frequently, check water quality daily, and denote this on checklist. Ideal ammonia and nitrite levels are 0ppm. At designated time of interest up to 40 days post-fertilization, remove fish with a small clean net Place fish in beaker containing MS-222 euthanasia dose (300 mg/L). Wait for fish’s operculum to stop moving, wait 10 minutes and fix. Fix appropriately in liquid nitrogen, 4%PFA, or Bouin’s. If downstream application requires instantaneous, non stressed measurement of gene transcription, remove fish from water, rapidly blot, and sacrifice directly into liquid nitrogen or RNAlater.

"],["mono-associated-protocol-for-stickleback.html", "17.3 Mono-associated Protocol for Stickleback", " 17.3 Mono-associated Protocol for Stickleback 17.3.1 Purpose: This protocol is used to determine whether the microbial community of one strain of stickleback can colonize the gut of another strain that is evolutionarily different. This protocol has been adapted for use in stickleback from an established, approved zebrafish protocol. 17.3.2 Procedure: The bacterial inoculums should be determined empirically for each species used. For many bacteria 104 Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per milliliter of stickleback medium will suffice for full colonization of the intestine and minimal toxicity to the fish. Dead larvae in the flask will be removed as this will often result in increased bacterial growth that can ultimately be fatal to the remaining larvae. The method below is used for several proteobacteria strains. Raise fish in a germ-free environment as described. Incubate bacteria for 16 hours in 50ml of growth medium in 250 ml flask at 25°C, 200 RPM. These bacteria will originate from the intestine of a healthy stickleback to ensure that the bacteria are not pathogens. Measure the Optical Density600 (OD600) of the culture. Calculate the original culture density, assuming 1 OD600 = 109 CFU / ml. Dilute the culture to pre-determined concentration as needed in filter sterilized stickleback medium, and inoculate flask in tissue culture hood. The fish will be exposed to the bacteria in the water after their digestive system is open and they have been shown to consume food, which occurs between 9 and 13 days post fertilization. The inoculums will be determined in a manner similar to those already established for zebrafish and used regularly in the Guillemin laboratory. Germ-free fish water is inoculated between 1000 and 1000000 bacteria per milliliter so the concentration the concentration can be chosen that results in healthy fish surviving to three days post-exposure. Plate dilutions of the original bacterial culture in order to verify the CFU/ml of the inoculum. Monitor fish daily for signs of illness, including lack of motility, response to external stimuli, rapid movement of opercular (gill) cover and any other sign of non-normal behavior. If a dead fish is found, remove fish and place in morgue (see Sick and Dead fish SOP), record on daily checklist and alert supervisor. At the end of the experiment, euthanize fish by established and approved protocols (see approved stickleback euthanasia protocol).

Key personnel have dedicated desk space in the laboratory or adjoining offices. 21.1.4 Computer The Cresko Lab has several Macintosh, Windows and Linux computers, including a dedicated computer cluster (48 cores, 541GB of memory, 67TB local general purpose storage in a hardware RAID60 configuration, 64TB local backup storage in two hardware RAID6 configurations) for analyzing large data sets. All computers are networked to the university system via 100G connections. The Cresko Lab also hosts several community accessible services: an installation of OMERO image server (at http://omero.uoregon.edu) serves as a repository of cross-referenced stickleback microsopy images for the Cresko Lab and collaborators; the Metagenomics online database (http://metagenomics.uoregon.edu/metagenomicsdb), which was developed in house to serve the Microbial Ecology and Theory of Animals (META) Center for Systems Biology (http://meta.uoregon.edu/); the Stickleback Database (http://sticklebackdb.uoregon.edu:8080/sticklebackdb/) was developed in house to track stickleback crosses and collections from the wild; and RNA-seqlopedia (http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu) was written by the Cresko Lab and provides an overview of RNA-seq and of the experimental design choices necessary to carry out a successful RNA-seq project. 21.1.5 ANIMAL: The Cresko Lab operates a newly renovated stickleback aquatic facility (690 sq. ft.) capable of housing up to 4000 adult fish and 144 individualized genetic crosses, and contains experiment space specially designed for microscopy and microinjection of embryos for CRISPR, and production of gnotobiotic stickleback (i.e., fish with experimenter-defined microbial communities, including fish with no microbes, or with one or more microbial strains). The facility is managed by Mark Currey (senior research assistant), who designed and maintains the husbandry systems and databases, and directs a staff of animal care technicians. The facility, located in the Institute of Ecology and Evolution adjacent to the Cresko Lab, is completely enclosed allowing for the care and maintenance of multiple lines of stickleback that have been derived from natural populations. Most of these lines have been in continuous culture since 2003 with current stocks representing over 12 generations in the facility. Two of the rooms are used to house animals and each room is outfitted with a dedicated recirculating aquaculture system. Lighting in these rooms is manipulated so that one room is set up for a summer lighting regime and the other a winter lighting regime. These lighting regimes allow for the conditioning of the fish to breed (summer regime) and for growing the fish from fry to adults (winter regime). These facilities allow for the ability to perform specific crosses in a controlled environment at precise times so that development can be standardized and quantified. The third room is used for experiments, and to store and prepare food and husbandry supplies. Half of this room is dedicated for experimental manipulations such as the microinjection procedures of CRISPR or for generating gnotobiotic fish. This is one of several model fish facilities at the University of Oregon, and helps maintain compliance for the university’s AAALAC accreditation. UO, known as the birthplace of zebrafish research, has a full-time staffed zebrafish facility (see Aquatic Animal Care Services). Expertise in fish husbandry gathered by developing the zebrafish system at Oregon augments and supports the successful husbandry of stickleback. 21.1.6 Equipment Microscopes (fluorescent, compound, dissecting, confocal), centrifuges, sonication and bead beating apparatus, cold rooms, freezers, thermocyclers, spectrophotometers and fluorometers, -80C and liquid nitrogen freezers, and other equipment are either in our lab or available nearby as shared equipment.

The PSI servers are port-restricted from the rest of the UO network using high-end network firewall appliances and are accessible only through secure means. All data files are protected by a strict access control rules, and access is provided to only a small group of trusted users who require it, thus reducing the exposure of sensitive data. If further data-security is needed, PSI has a special securely-encrypted storage area that has further restrictions in place to prevent any unauthorized data transmissions. Zoom: UO faculty members, staff, and students have access to Zoom videoconferencing services. For UO Zoom users who handle HIPAA-regulated data, a HIPAA-compliant environment is available that includes Zoom, which establishes strict access control rules and strong AES256 encryption to prevent transmission of any PHI (protected health information). VPN: PSI and Cresko lab faculty and staff have access to a VPN connection, when off campus, to servers. The VPN utilizes Cisco AnyConnect platform and is secured with end-to-end strong AES256, and then TLS1.2 for any key exchange or authentication. VPN Users are placed into a specific network pool that is then further port restricted from any critical systems. This gives VPN users the benefit of still being able to access their data, where allowed, but prevents VPN users from accessing any critical administration items or underlying infrastructure. Workstations: PSI has made available workstation and laptops available to its faculty and staff, so as to allow them to continue their work confidently and securely.

"],["university-of-oregon-research-core-facilities.html", "21.7 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON RESEARCH CORE FACILITIES:", " 21.7 UNIVERSITY OF OREGON RESEARCH CORE FACILITIES: The University of Oregon is well known for integrative research, has broad collaborative expertise and houses many shared facilities. A network of Research Core Facilities (RCFs) are managed by the Office of the Vice President for Research and Innovation (OVPRI). This network provides infrastructure and services in many technological areas. Each RCF is staffed by a director and other personnel and are available to researchers from across all parts of the university, and those from outside the university. The RCFs are run in a research compliant fashion using subsidy from the OVPRI for the Director’s salary and the proportional salaries of members of Research Core Business Services who are well trained in finance and compliance. Below is a list of the salient RCFs for this project. 21.7.1 Genomics and Cell Characterization Core Facility: This facility is directed by Dr. Doug Turnbull and staffed by top genomics personnel, including several full time laboratory technicians and the General and Technical Supervisor for the CLIA laboratory. In anticipation of the growing need to support SARS-CoV-2 testing, the facility is beginning searches for three additional laboratory technicians. The main laboratory houses Illumina NovaSeq, NextSeq500 and MiSeq massively parallel sequencers and two systems for use in long molecule sequencing: 10x Genomics’s platform for producing short-read Illumina-compatible DNA- or RNA-seq libraries starting from nucleic acids or from single cells and a PacBio Sequel II. These platforms are run by Dr. Turnbull and his staff, who also provide sequencing library preparation services, particularly for the PacBio and 10x Genomics platforms. Output data are initially processed by computer scientist Nicholas Stiffler. The facility charges for reagents, personnel time, and service contract. The facility’s sequencing, fragment analysis and library preparation services will continue to be a critical part of our research program. This facility also oversees a dedicated biological imaging space that contains specialty microscopes including light sheet, confocals, and the expertise needed to effectively use them. The CLIA testing laboratory described is administratively part of GC3F. Illumina HiSeq4000, NextSeq500 and MiSeq massively parallel sequencers PacBio Sequel2 10x Genomics’ platforms Two flow cytometers (Sony SH800 Cell Sorter and Applied Biosystems Attune Cytometer) Eppendorf EPMotion 5075 TMX liquid handling robot 128 thread primary analysis server for processing next generation sequencing data Suite of advanced light microscopes including a Zeiss Elyra and Nikon Sora for super-resolution imaging Sequencing, fragment analysis, and library preparation services and equipment 21.7.2 Research Advanced Computing Services (RACS) and Talapas high performance cluster: Talapas is the University of Oregon’s primary supercomputer. It was built in 2017 and is managed by Director Dr. Nick Maggio and his staff. The Cresko laboratory has an unlimited membership to the cluster via a yearly membership. Talapas is a heterogeneous supercomputing cluster capable of performing over 1.2 quadrillion calculations per second and providing 1.5 petabytes (1,500 trillion bytes) of high performance, parallel data storage. Talapas makes three distinct classes of compute nodes available to researchers: standard compute nodes built around the Intel “Broadwell” and “Skylake” generations of processor, GPU compute nodes equipped with dual nVidia Tesla K80 accelerators, and large memory servers. This large compute cluster has over 200 standard nodes with at least 128GB of memory each, 24 GPU nodes with 256GB memory each, and 8 large memory nodes with 1TB to 4TB of memory each. Talapas computational and storage resources are networked together via EDR Infiniband and connected to Internet2 via a high-speed 100 GigE interconnect. Talapas is open to all UO researchers and students for scientific research. Heterogeneous supercomputing cluster capable of performing over 250 trillion calculations ever second and providing 1.5 petabytes (1,500 trillion bytes) of high performance, parallel data storage Standard compute nodes built around the Intel “Broadwell” generation of processor, GPU compute nodes equipped with dual nVidia Tesla K80 accelerators, and large memory servers 96 standard nodes with 128GB of memory each, 24 GPU nodes with 256GB memory each, and 8 large memory nodes with 4TB of memory each The cluster presently has 1.5 Petabytes of storage (soon to be 10 Petabytes) 21.7.3 Aquatic Animal Care Services: This service, directed by Timothy Mason, provides cutting edge animal husbandry and experimental expertise for working with aquatic animals. The facility maintains housing and veterinary care for zebrafish stocks with a capacity of more than a million fish, husbandry training, and cryopreservation of sperm, and provides experiment rooms for microinjection and other research activities. UO is the birthplace of zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model vertebrate, having been pioneered by Dr. George Streisinger in the 1970s. The amassed expertise in zebrafish at this facility and in the many UO research labs it serves has greatly facilitated the development of other emerging aquatic models at the UO, including threespine stickleback and spotted gar. 21.7.4 Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC): ZIRC, co-directed by Zoltan Varga and Monte Westerfield, is across the street from our lab, and it provides the world’s central repository for wild-type and mutant strains of zebrafish and for materials and information about zebrafish research. They distribute materials and zebrafish strains to the international research community. ZIRC provides pathology services for potentially diseased fish, including those from the Cresko Lab stickleback facility. 21.7.5 Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) (http://zfin.org): ZFIN is an online digital resource that contains and distributes information about zebrafish research to the world. These resources include information about zebrafish genetics, genomics, and development, among many other things. ZFIN also provides a clearing house for information on researchers to encourage collaboration networks. Having this vast repository of information and tools for fish developmental genetics easily accessible greatly enhances our ability to perform evolutionary developmental analysis. 21.7.6 Biological Imaging Core: This facility brings together specialty microscopes including light sheet, laser capture microdissection, confocals, and the expertise needed to effectively use them. These resources will be critical in the three-dimensional visualization and documentation of transgene expression in living sticklebacks, as well as observation of living microbial endosymbionts in the stickleback gut. The light sheet microscope has already proven itself for studying interactions of microbes in the gut of living zebrafish larvae here at UO, and we will be able to adapt these methodologies to using stickleback larvae. 21.7.7 Histology and Genetic Modification Core Facility: This facility, directed by Dr. Ute Hostick, offers cryo-, paraffin and plastic sectioning, and histological staining. These services will be useful for phenotyping of mutant stickleback strains, when characterization by in situ hybridization on cryosectioned tissue or histological staining of fixed, sectioned tissue is required. This cutting edge facility also provides many procedures for generating and strain storage of genetically modified mice, including pronuclear injection, embryo cryopreservation stem cell tissue culture and genotyping. 21.7.8 Center for Advanced Materials Characterization in Oregon (CAMCOr): This facility, directed by Kurt Langworthy, houses multiple TEM and SEM microscopes, and many apparatus for NMR, X-ray crystallography, and other specialized microscopy for life sciences, materials science and chemistry applications. In addition, the facility houses resource for nanofabrication and microfluidics. In addition, a new Zeiss Versa X-ray microscope housed in this facility produces exquisite 3-D high resolution scans of biological and non-biological subjects non-destructively. 21.7.9 Technical Science Administration: This facility, directed by John Boosinger, houses professional machinists and electrical engineers who help design and build research instrumentation. For the Cresko research group, this has included such diverse things as fish husbandry and microinjection equipment. 21.7.10 Lewis Center for Neuroimaging: This facility, directed by Fred Sabb, supports research in cognitive science and biological imaging and includes a Siemens Skyra functional MRI and staff who design and fabricate MR coils suited to a variety of projects. 21.7.11 Molecular Biology Kitchen: This facility provides us with media, plates, sterilized pipette tips, buffers, and clean glassware for molecular biology and bacteriology needs. 21.7.12 Lab Supply Stores: Laboratory supplies and small equipment are available for purchase in a centralized store maintained by Thermofisher in a science building adjacent to ours.

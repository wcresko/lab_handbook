Our laboratory studies the developmental genetic and genomic basis of evolution in natural populations. We use the threespine stickleback and zebrafish as the main animal models in the laboratory, as well as syngnathid. We have produced some of the first work that has helped develop stickleback into a model for dissecting the genetic basis of natural variation. We have developed genomic tools such as sequenced Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) tags that help geneticists apply Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies to biomedical and evolutionary genetic problems. These techniques allow for the efficient identification of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genomes of models and non-model organisms. We produced the first SNP whole genome-scan for selection in the stickleback genome, and we developed novel Maximum Likelihood (ML) analytical tools for NGS data. Computational biologists and computer scientists in our team have produced software packages for genomic analyses that are used by laboratories around the world for the analysis of big data problems. Our laboratory has developed protocols, best practices, and tools for RNA-seq based transcriptomic functional analyses.

EMERGENCY CONTACT: dial 911 first, AND 6-2919 (EHS) | Mark Cell 541-505-0006 Safety Shower, Eyewash, Fire Extinguishers. Eyewashes must be flushed weekly. Undergraduate research assistants are responsible for flushing the safety showers each week. _Each lab member is responsible for knowing the locations of safety showers and fire extinguishers in the lab. Safety showers and fire extinguishers are tested annually by EHS. Wear a lab coat and closed-toed shoes when working with the following chemicals: organics (e.g. phenol/chloroform, Trizol, DNAzol, formaldehyde, formamide, methanol) strong acids and bases Wear eye protection when working with: UV light (UV opaque glasses/face shield) phenol/chloroform, strong acids/bases, and any splash hazard with anything hazardous in it. Wear safety gloves when working with ANY of the reagents above. Heed the “one glove rule”: remove one glove when moving between rooms to avoid touching doorknobs with a contaminated glove. Note that glove materials differ in their permeability to different reagents. Standard nitrile gloves are adequate for our lab’s standard procedures. However, if you are planning experiments that involve more dangerous reagents, consult with Luke Sitts at EHS to select appropriate gloves. Disposal of common hazardous reagents (EHS DISPOSAL: 6-3192) E. coli plates and recombinant materials: autoclave buckets or EHS biohazard incineration boxes E. coli flasks/liquids: bleach, rinse, drain Used alcohols, formaldehyde, and kit waste: waste containers under the thermocyclers. organic solvents: waste bottles in hood. Storage of Hazardous Liquids Store flammables and strong acids in a latched METAL SAFETY CABINET UNDER THE HOOD. Heating Liquids in the Microwave Oven** Triple check that the cap is very loose or (better) remove it entirely. Remelting of gels with DNA binding dyes is forbidden. Bunsen Burners Triple check that the gas is shut completely off before you leave the bench/ hood. keep burners far away from any flammable liquids. Liquid Nitrogen and Dry Ice Use only in well ventilated spaces to avoid asphyxiation. Never store in sealed containers to avoid explosions Wear lab coat, gloves, goggles. In case of frostbite or burn, soak affected part in tepid water, seek medical attention "],["lone-worker-guidelines.html", "Chapter 6 Lone worker guidelines", " Chapter 6 Lone worker guidelines The UO Laboratory Safety Advisory Committee (LSAC) feels that working alone in laboratories should be discouraged but recognizes that a prohibition would hinder the research and education missions of the UO. To advance personnel safety while also recognizing research needs, the LSAC developed this guidance document to assist lab workers in recognizing dangers and developing appropriate procedures. The primary danger in working alone is that if an accident should occur, there will be delays in rendering aid. Before working alone, you should: Ensure that you have been trained on the procedures, reviewed the safety data sheets for all associate materials, and know the emergency procedures for your lab. Consider whether the risk outweighs the benefits of working alone. Consider whether this work can be done at a time when others are around. Consider using a buddy system with individuals in other labs nearby. If you decide to proceed with hazardous procedures on your own, please use a check-in or text-in system with supervisors or peers, ensuring that they know where and when this work is done and that they have contact information readily available for campus safety personnel. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR THIS LABORATORY Examples of materials and procedures in THIS laboratory that should be avoided while working alone are provided below. Should you choose to do lone work of this nature, ensure that others know where and when this work will be performed, and when it is completed.

Saturated Brine Combine: ~25g Rock Salt to 4.0 L with tap water Aerate to dissolve. 8.6.1 Procedure: Cyst hydration: Hydrate one full can of dried cyst in 5 L of tap water in a hatching cone with aeration for 1 hour at room temp. Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step. If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min. Filter and rinse cysts: Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 um mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water. Transfer cysts back to the cone: Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone. De-capsulation: Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange, When the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 um mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water. Neutralization residual chlorine: To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear. Dehydration for long-term storage: Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200 - 300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine. Store in refrigerator. The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month. Hatch brine as you would capsulated brine (see Hatching and Feeding Brine SOP).

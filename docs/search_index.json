Our laboratory studies the developmental genetic and genomic basis of evolution in natural populations. We use the threespine stickleback and zebrafish as the main animal models in the laboratory, as well as syngnathid. We have produced some of the first work that has helped develop stickleback into a model for dissecting the genetic basis of natural variation. We have developed genomic tools such as sequenced Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) tags that help geneticists apply Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies to biomedical and evolutionary genetic problems. These techniques allow for the efficient identification of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genomes of models and non-model organisms. We produced the first SNP whole genome-scan for selection in the stickleback genome, and we developed novel Maximum Likelihood (ML) analytical tools for NGS data. Computational biologists and computer scientists in our team have produced software packages for genomic analyses that are used by laboratories around the world for the analysis of big data problems. Our laboratory has developed protocols, best practices, and tools for RNA-seq based transcriptomic functional analyses.

To advance personnel safety while also recognizing research needs, the LSAC developed this guidance document to assist lab workers in recognizing dangers and developing appropriate procedures. The primary danger in working alone is that if an accident should occur, there will be delays in rendering aid. Before working alone, you should: Ensure that you have been trained on the procedures, reviewed the safety data sheets for all associate materials, and know the emergency procedures for your lab. Consider whether the risk outweighs the benefits of working alone. Consider whether this work can be done at a time when others are around. Consider using a buddy system with individuals in other labs nearby. If you decide to proceed with hazardous procedures on your own, please use a check-in or text-in system with supervisors or peers, ensuring that they know where and when this work is done and that they have contact information readily available for campus safety personnel.

Currey) ### Materials Needed: • 25, 45 and 90mm disposable sterile petri dishes (standard) • Sterile Ginzburg’s Fish Ringers solution containing antibiotic and antimycotics for testes (see Testes Solution recipe) • MS222 Tricaine Methanesulfonate (see Mesab recipe) • 100% ethanol • Fine scissors and forceps • Wide-blade entomology forceps • Sterile Embryo medium (6ml of Instant Ocean into 1L npH2O) • Squeeze wash bottles • Stress coat (standard from pet store) • Sterile flat razor blades • Sterile disposable large bore transfer pipettes (VWR cat# 691) • Dissecting microscope Squeeze Female: Cover fingers with stress coat and gently squeeze gravid female. Gravid females have extended abdomens and their eggs have “dropped.” If eggs do not emerge with very slight pressure the female is not quite ready. Squeeze eggs with motion from pectoral girdle posterior to the cloaca into a 25mm sterile petri dish. The small size of petri dish allows the sperm to be concentrated on the eggs. Dissect Testes From Male: Euthanize male by placing him into a finger bowl of embryo medium containing a lethal volume of MS222. Clean a large, 30cm by 60cm or similar size, glass sheet, fine scissors, and forceps with 100% ethanol. When male is motionless, remove and rinse fish with clean water and sever spinal cord behind skull using a razor to be sure of euthanization. Use scissors to make incision just posterior to the cloaca and cut from there anteriorly to the pelvic girdle making an incision along the mid line of the fish. Make another cut to each side of the fish from the cloaca dorsally approximately 15mm so that the body cavity is easily accessed. Incisions should be made just deep enough to cut the skin and body wall muscle while being wary to not cut into the stomach and intestines that are located just below the skin surface. Locate paired testes and vas deferens (testes are variable in shape and coloration, but are usually long and pigmented, usually having the same pigmentation as the skin surface, and sit in the dorsal part of the coelom near the kidneys. The vas deferens are threadlike and are usually as long as the testis to which it connects. Use fine forceps to grab vas deferens, sever near the cloaca, and remove one (or often) both testes. Doing so keeps the testes intact, allowing them to contain viable sperm for up to 1 month at 4°C in Testes Solution. Storing of Testes: If only a single cross is to be made with a male, proceed to step 4. Otherwise, place testes into 45mm petri dish filled with cold Testes Solution. Store testes at 4°C. To store testes for extended periods, change out medium once a week. Prepare Testis: If multiple crosses are to be performed from a single pair of male’s testes, remove one testis and place on the inside lid of the 25mm petri dish into which a females eggs have been squeezed. Using a sterile razor, slice off a small piece of testis (we’ve found a large testis can be used to fertilize approximately 5 clutches). Make cuts as perpendicular as possible to the major axis of the testis and perform multiple cuts from the same end. This allows as much of the sperm to remain packaged and inactivated at the center of the testis. Use blade to macerate testis. Under a dissecting scope swimming sperm should cause a ‘sparkling’ refraction. Add approximately 1.0 ml of sterile embryo medium to testis prep with disposable pipette, mix, and then add to the eggs one drop at a time, using same disposable pipette, dispersing drops between petri dishes so that all eggs are covered with sperm mixture. Fertilization (time = 0): Fertilization of most eggs will occur almost instantaneously. However, I leave the sperm on the eggs for about 5-10 minutes. At this point cover embryos with embryo medium. Mark fertilization time (this is the time that the initial drops of sperm were added) on the surface of the petri dish. Place in incubator at 20°C. Separation of Embryos and Second Cleaning (t = 2 hr): The animal pole of the embryo is established at the site of sperm entry, and at 20°C the first cell syncitium is usually visible within 45 minutes. The first cell division usually occurs approximately 25 minutes later, and the two cell stage is fully visible approximately 1.5hr after fertilization. During this time, the chorion thickens and attaches to the petri dish as well as to other embryos. At or after 2 hours post fertilization, use the wide blade entomological forceps to detach the embryos from one another, as well as to dislodge embryos from the bottom of the petri dish. Remove all of the unfertilized eggs to limit mold contamination, and record the total number of eggs and embryos. Rinse embryos 3 to 4 more times then distribute embryos to 90mm petri dishes (30-50 embryos per dish) filled half way with fresh embryo medium. Enter cross information into database, print labels for dishes, and place embryos into incubator at 20°C. Raise Embryos (check daily): Embryos will develop at approximately 2.5 times zebrafish time [see http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/stages/index.html], and hatch at approximately 7 days. 48hr stickleback embryos have completed most major morphogenetic processes, and the melanic pigment cells are just starting to migrate.

Hatching, Begin Feeding Brine Shrimp, and Move to System (t = 7-8 days post fertilization): After hatching at 7-8 days post fertilization, remove chorions and allow young to absorb yolk (2-3 days). At approximately day 2 post hatching take petri dish containing fry out of incubator and place dishes on a table. To each petri dish add approximately the same volume of system water, as there is embryo medium; this will double the volume of liquid in the dish. This acclimates the fry to the system water. Allow the fry to acclimate for 6-10 hours, the longer the better. Then transfer fry to small aquaria on the system.

Examine the cyst under a dissecting scope with top lighting before proceeding. Dry cysts are dimpled, resembling a deflated basketball, whereas fully hydrated cysts are completely spherical in shape. The cysts must be fully hydrated prior to the de-capsulation step. If cysts are not completely spherical after 1 hour, continue the hydration process (for a maximum of 2 hours), checking the progress of the cysts under a microscope every 15 min. Filter and rinse cysts: Collect the hydrated cyst in a 125 um mesh bag and rinse with cool tap water. Transfer cysts back to the cone: Add the Buffered Salt Solution to the cone and aerate (save back a filled squirt bottle of salt solution to help transfer cysts to cone). Transfer cysts into cone. De-capsulation: Add the bleach (4.3 L) to the cone and continue aeration. Watch the cysts turn from brown to grey to orange, When the cysts are 90% orange, stop the reaction by quickly siphoning the cysts through a 125 um mesh bag and rinsing well with cool tap water. Neutralization residual chlorine: To neutralize any residual chlorine transfer the mesh bag to a clean 4 L beaker and pour the 1.0% Sodium Thiosulfate (3L) into the bag. Soak the cysts in the sodium thiosulfate solution for ~1 min, then rinse the cysts with de-ionized tap water. Rinse until discharge turns clear. Dehydration for long-term storage: Transfer the cysts back to the cone with 4 L of saturated brine and aerate until salt is dissolved. Transfer dehydrated cyst to (5 or 6) 1 L Nalgene bottles filled with 200 - 300 grams of salt. Add enough salt so that it does not dissolve when de-capsulated brine is added. Fill the bottles with de-capsulated brine. Store in refrigerator. The de-capsulated brine will store for at least 1 month.

Siphon (cleaning by “vacuuming”) Attach siphon tip onto siphon hose. The siphon tips, which are attached to the hoses, are the only parts of this apparatus that can be immersed in the tank. Start siphon by running system water into hose until hose is filled with water. Turn valve so that water is “trapped” in hose. Put end of tip into tank that is being cleaned and turn valve back on creating a siphon. Vacuum all waste off of the bottom being careful to not suck up any fish. Use each tip in only one tank and then sterilize it by washing in the dishwasher (see Dishwasher SOP). Scrubbing (removal of algae from sides, front, and back of tank) is done on an “as needed” basis. (If you can’t see into the tank, it’s past time to scrub.) With a Scotch Brite Pad (United Grocers, Eugene, Oregon) scrub front and sides of tank. Do not use pad on multiple tanks. Autoclave scrubber pads to sterilize. Replace basket of bulkhead. Take the dirty basket off and sterilize in dishwasher as described above. Obtain clean basket and replace. Note: When using bleach and/or sodium thiosulfate. Eye protection is required. Please use splash proof glasses or a face shield when using bleach and sodium thiosulfate. Complete bleaching and cleaning of tank. This needs to be done to each tank every 2 months. Remove fish from tank and put them into a clean tank. Tanks that are emptied of fish need to be cleaned and sterilized before another batch of fish can be introduced. Drain the tank and remove it from the rack. Clean all parts with brushes and a scrub pad or put into the bleach bin. Clean the tank thoroughly with a scrub pad, taking care not to damage the silicon water seals on the inside (algae should be left if very gentle rubbing will not remove it. Squirt about 10 – 20 mls of bleach into the tank. Wash the bleach water thoroughly around the inside of the tank by hand, using a pad, sponge, tank back, or other means to expose all inside portions of the tank to bleach. Rinse the tank thoroughly with hot tap water. Rinse the tank with sodium thiosulfate, and then rinse it again with hot water. Put a few thiosulfate crystals into the tank and leave it. Reassemble the tank and put it back on the rack. Fill with system water and allow water to recirculate for about 30 minutes before adding fish. Watch fish for 15min to look for any signs of distress.

If some are still wet, set them out to dry on the drying rack before putting them away. RINSE ALL DIRTY DISHES VERY WELL, especially those with algae/food residue. the dishwasher will sanitize, but will not effectively clean, the dishes. Scrub dishes with a scrub pad to remove buildup, if needed. Tank tube and bulkhead pieces should be hung on the vertical rinsing pipes on the bottom rack; longer tank tubes should be placed on the top rack if they would impede the rinser on the bottom of the top rack from spinning. Small tank lids should be stacked on the bottom rack, but not on the raised portion of the rack, as this impedes the rinser from spinning properly. Plastic tanks, Ziploc containers and long tank tubes should be placed on the top rack. BEFORE RUNNING THE DISHWASHER, SLIDE BOTH RACKS IN AND MAKE SURE THE RINSER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TOP RACK CAN SPIN FREELY 11.4.2 Running the dishwasher: Add ~1/2 scoop of dish detergent (found under the sink) to the well in the door of the dishwasher. Close the lid to the well. Close and latch the door to the dishwasher. The display will light up, and after booting up it should read “User 1.” Press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle. If it instead displays a list of programs, use the down arrow key to navigate down the list to “User 1.” When the “User 1” program is highlighted, press the RUN/CANCEL button to begin the cycle. If the screen displays something other than “User 1,” press the DISPLAY button to show the list of programs, scroll down to “User 1,” and press RUN/CANCEL. Should the program ever need to be cancelled mid-cycle, pressing the RUN/CANCEL button once will result in the cycle canceling and the water draining. 11.4.3 Large tank lids: • The small frontal lids to the large glass tanks should be loaded into the dishwasher. The large lids to the large glass tanks should be hosed off thoroughly with very hot water, and set on the rack to dry.

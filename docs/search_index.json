MESAB: Tricaine: 3-amino benzoic acid ethyl ester from Sigma (Cat # A-5040). Mix in fish safe container with a stir bar: 400 mg tricaine powder 800 mg Na2HPO4 (anhydrous) 100 ml glass distilled water Adjust to ~pH 7 with a drop at a time of 1N NaOH or 1N HCl if needed but it’s usually right if you weigh the sodium phosphate carefully and measure the water with a graduated cylinder. For storage: Aliquot into 6 x 25 ml fish safe plastic bottles and store at 4C. Label with date made and use within a couple of weeks. 8% PFA: {#pfa .subhead2} 8 g Pelleted PFA (Ted Pella, Inc.; cat# 18501) 90 ml dH2O 25 drops 1N NaOH Heat at very low heat and stir until solution clears. Add 25 drops 1N HCl. pH should be 7.0-7.2. Filter and store at 4C not more than 1 week. Use as 4% PFA: dilute 1:1 with 2X PBS, do not store solution more than a few hours. 2X PBS {#x-pbs .subhead2} 1.6% NaCl 0.04% KCl 0.04 M PO4 pH 7.0- 7.3 6.1.3 Procedure: Day Step Time for Step Date and Time 1 2h-8h at R/T depending on size on shaker. 1h or longer at R/T on shaker. Without agitation and with lid open until eyes start to lighten and all skin pigment is gone (usually about an hour or more) 2 2 h to O/N at R/T on shaker 2 h to overnight O/N at R/T on shaker. Check for bone staining. R/T on shaker until excess stain in tissue is gone. Without agitation Wild caught specimens are put in 100% EtOH in the field and then rehydrated and put into 4% when back in the lab. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]

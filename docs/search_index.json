In ecology, the last author is generally the PI of the lab (although not always). The remaining authors are usually listed in their order of contribution. However, if contributions were equivalent, then co-authors can be alphabetized or ordered according to their time since involvement in the project.

Fry are fed once per day Adult – newly hatched brine shrimp, Adult brine shrimp, Moina. Adults are fed once per day. Feed adult brine shrimp when we have them. Use moina when we are out of adult brine shrimp. Adult brine shrimp are from a local fish store and are only available every tow weeks. They last ~ one week and therefore adult pipefish are fed adult brine shrimp for one week and moina the next. Fry: Fry tanks are designated with an orange dot. Newly hatched brine: Collect newly hatched brine and place into a squirt bottle (see brine shrimp SOP). Feed all tanks with an orange dot. Adults: Adult tanks are designated with a yellow dot. Newly hatched brine: Collect newly hatched brine and place into a squirt bottle (see brine shrimp SOP). Feed all tanks with an orange dot. Frozen Mysis: Obtain a quarter-sized piece of frozen mysis from the freezer. Place into squirt bottle and add water. Wait until mysis thaws and feed to all adult tanks. Adult Brine shrimp: Scoop out adult brine shrimp with net. Wash into a ball and place over the top of squirt bottle. Wash ball of brine into squirt bottle and feed all adult pipefish.

Juvenile Collection (Daily): Turn off water to tanks. Remove collection cup, using mysid system water, rinse juveniles into plastic container. Pour juveniles into grow out tank. Replace collection cup. Turn water on and start siphon. Adults collection and feeding to pipefish: Juvenile will reach adult size in three weeks. At three weeks these new adults will replace old breeding adults. The old breeding adults that are being replaced are feed to the pipefish.
